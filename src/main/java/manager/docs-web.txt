Contact Us Search Monument valley defies the physical brick Monument Valley is a beautiful puzzle game developed and published by Ustwo Games  In the game you guide the silent Princess Ida through mysterious monuments uncovering hidden paths taking advantage of optical illusions and outsmarting the enigmatic Crow People Described as a surreal exploration through fantastical architecture and impossible geometry it doesn t immediately sound easy to build from LEGO but that s exactly what qian yj has achieved The six main structures are colourful whimsical with an Escherlike  quality of illusion thanks to stairs and clever use of colour and angles Each structure appears simple at first but sections are not as connected as they first seem and there are some apparently floating areas within the builds  The apparently simple surreal structures are the attraction of the game itself  and LEGO seems like an ideal medium to transfer the art from the screen The closeup views of each structure can be seen in the builder s Flickr album but even better is this video showcasing the creations with a mix of LEGO and Princess Ida animation Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook

heartwrenching scene from season 2 of The Walking Dead  I can still recall the sense of dread as the camera focuses on the small gap in the barn door and Sophia emerges from the darkness The barn itself is wonderfully detailed and weathered While the use of so many different grass elements along the edge of the barn conveys a sense of managed chaos as nature starts to reclaim civilization There are so many other details worth mentioning in this LEGO creation besides the barn itself The use of stalks of Technic connectors to form the gnarled tree the wire fence and the tractor are also great touches I also love the use of some fairly old wheel rims for the flatbed cart Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Daniel November

One of the latest and greatest propellerdriven aircraft of WW2 is surely the F4U Corsair The American fighter is instantly recognizable with its inverted gull wing Brought to life in LEGO by Patrick MAGO this monster of a model is built at a scale of roughly 110 It has a wingspan of 1 meter and weighs in at a hefty 6 kg 13 pounds It took Patrick approximately 10 months to build the model and he had to redesign it no less than 3 times during the process to deal with the weight Beyond the structure itself a big challenge in such a build is the limited selection of dark blue parts available

the Seraphim reconnaissance jet by Corvin Stichert seems to resemble the stepping stone between the SR71 Blackbird and the SSV Normandy SR1 from Mass Effect  Although the builder had more of the former in mind when building surely it s ultrafast aircraft like this that will eventually eliminate the boundary between sky and space Corvin puts all the curved slopes and wedges to excellent use in shaping the body resulting in a craft that seems primed for radar deflection rather than merely a little pixelated as a consequence of the bricks My favorite touch on this model is the realistic working landing gear and ordnance bays on the underside Corvin has also created a full ground crew to accompany the aircraft Now all it needs is an Area 51 hangar Like this post Tell all your friends

of Duty franchise  Black Ops II  was added to Xbox One backwards compatibility I picked up Treyarch Studios s 2012 vision of combat in 2025 again and felt inspired to build my favorite rifle in the game the M8A1 a rifle based on the real H K XM8  In addition to being inspired by the design of the gun itself I was motivated to build by the color scheme Most of the rifle in game is tan but its carry handle has a subtle bronze color I showed this color difference with two LEGO colors tan and medium dark flesh The latter color is fairly limited in parts selection which made its implementation a fun challenge Working features on the LEGO M8A1 include a moving trigger removable curved magazine and a sliding ambidextrous charging handle The tactical rail on the carry handle can attach a LEGO reflex sight that projects a red aiming dot onto a window piece I show and discuss these functions as well as a few techniques used to achieve the detail on the weapon in this four minute video See

out there it is easy to forget other important battles of the time The siege of Bastogne was the last major German offensive on the Western Front during WW2 and an important turning point Lasting from 2126 december 1944 the battle took many lives as did the frigid cold This collaborative display depicting the battle directed by Ekjohnson1  won multiple awards at Brickfair Virginia There is so much to see in the diorama but some of the highlights include the excellent battle damage on the houses the church and the forested area just outside the town Collaborations can be very hard to do with

win the war In December 1941 the National Service Act made the conscription of women legal in the UK employing those of working age in essential work for the war effort When production of tanks planes boats and munitions were needed the women of Britain were called on to come into the factories and build the war machines and without them success would not have been possible Martin Harris has built a tribute to these women and his scene is set in a converted railway station using the track as an assembly line for the Britishmade Churchill tanks  Women are the primary workers However you can see that there is an older man who has just turned up after work to help with turret placement I had to try and forgive Martin for having a yellow faced minifigure with flesh hands in the scene perhaps it is just me that finds that distressing to look at The overall scene is beautifully tied together as a cohesive whole I particularly love the old railway station backdrop with its large light fixtures

gold with this Elvesthemed diorama Heavily inspired by the Elves Netflix series and a bit of the official sets too the builder had the idea in her head for quite a while before amassing enough bright colours to realize it She notes that the diorama was a great opportunity to use not only new colours but new bricks too including many floral elements Angry Birds eggs and all sorts of Elves and Friends decorative elements The cliff in the back is recycled from an earlier diorama  with appropriate upgrades of course The foliage is bright and colourful as are the cute little cottages  exactly in the official theme s style There are interiors built for all the cottages but sadly the buildings don t come apart to bephotographed This diorama was one of my favourite builds at the 19th

been thinking about Friends minidolls and the retired LEGO ExoForce theme and perhaps eating a little too much cheese before bed What if ExoForce continued to evolve and then got assimilated by

Contact Us Search LEGO to rerelease 5923piece Taj Mahal on Cyber Monday 2017 News Today LEGO is announcing that the iconic 10189 Taj Mahal will be rereleased as Creator Expert 10256 Taj Mahal  Formerly the longtime record holder for Largest LEGO Set until being dethroned a few months ago by the new UCS Millennium Falcon  this set is still the secondlargest LEGO set of all time with 5923 pieces and will be available on November 27 aka Cyber Monday in LEGO stores and from the LEGO Shop Online for 36999 USD Interestingly the new set contains a single piece more than its predecessor released in 2008 though the model is indistinguishable from its earlier twin The original Taj Mahal sold at retail for 29999 so the additional part plus inflation has resulted in a 70 increase since it was available a decade ago  Looking through TBB archives  the original was once discounted to 249 Widely known as the crown jewel of many LEGO fans  collections the Taj Mahal currently commands a premium on the secondary market News of yet another massive rerelease will no doubt send prices into a whirl as it seems that LEGO is intentionally aiming to rerelease or redesign older massively popular sets which have garnered outlandish prices in 2017 alone we ve already had the UCS Snowspeeder and UCS Millennium Falcon  As of publication the cheapest unopened Taj Mahal set is selling for 3000 USD a price that will no doubt drop dramatically soon 2017 will certainly go down in history as the year of big sets with a version of the top 11 largest LEGO sets ever all available for purchase

literally about to say that I agree with you wholeheartedly the extra piece is the brick seperator Reaven Veaceslav October 30 2017 at 700 am So it s going to be released for one day and inevitably be sold out after 10 minutes once the Store site stops crashing This sounds like it s going to end up the same way the Falcon release did What fun Dave Schefcik Post author October 30 2017 at 1033 am I am under the impression it will be available for more than just Cyber Monday It just happens that day is the first day of availability and will likely sell out quickly AL October 30 2017 at 1222 pm Very disappointing They need to stop relaunching old sets That ruins the value of the originals I you didn t get one the first time around tough And yes there are many sets I missed out on but I would never want them recreated If I really want it I should have to pay the premium that is the whole point of them becoming collector items Relaunching ruins that They did the same with one of the xmas sets a new carousel the falcon and now this Soon they will relaunch corne r cafe alabasterspoon October 30 2017 at 1236 pm One of the unique features I enjoyed about buying and collecting lego sets was the fact that each set was only available once Seems like soon you will be able to order any set past or present and the collecting of set will be a thing of the past opinionkeeper October 30 2017 at 1258 pm AL This is the most idiotic thing I ve heard online in a while and that s saying something Why would they not rerelease or remake popular sets if they think people would buy them That makes literally zero sense as a business They re here to make money and this makes them money Also the mentality that if someone couldn t get a set when it first came out cause you know some people started liking LEGO when they were kids and didn t exactly have 300 to spend on a set then they should have to pay ridiculous mark ups to people online is just greedy You kind of sound like you re sitting on top of a bunch of old sets to sell and are just afraid the bottom is going to drop out of the secondary market Purple Dave October 30 2017 at 456 pm opinionkeeper Remember a line called Legends It was made up of vintage sets that were rereleased Sometimes changes had to be made due to older elements having been retired but the core designs were taken directly from the old version It apparently flopped because they dropped it like a lead brick before it had been out a full year Turns out there are tons of people who want old set s They just can t agree on which old sets they want They also have to pass up a ton of new sets because there s just too much for most people to buy and adding vintage sets onto the pile doesn t make the pile more affordable Jordan Perry October 31 2017 at 1254 pm Lego does not care about the pile of discontinued mint sets you have stored away as your retirement plan They aren t selling collectibles to collectors they are selling toys to kids The good news is that you probably can still sell your old Taj Mahal for considerably above the old MSRP so you ll still come out ahead if you bought them when they were in production If you paid an inordinate sum of money from a reseller that s not Lego s fault Now if Lego put out a limited edition product and marketed it as a collectible CMFs for example I d be more inclined to side with you but that doesn t seem to be the case here Just like the Stock Market investing in anything as a collectible with the intent of reselling it carries some amount of risk Ask anyone who bought Beanie Babies haha Escairan October 31 2017 at 1135 pm My brother was there at the summer Perhaps it s a good idea to make a present in his birthday Thanks for the post Garrett November 2 2017 at 423 am That top 11 list is incorrect The 10188 Death Star of 2008 surpasses Joker Manor with 3803 pieces Purple Dave November 2 2017 at 507 pm Garrett The list is apparently only meant to include the most recent of any particular subject The third largest set ever made is the first UCS Millennium Falcon which is also not on this list The largest is the new UCSMF which is the one they included Likewise there s a newer Death Star playset so that s at 8 Rev1964 November 5 2017 at 612 am I am very happy about this I got into LEGO as a stress reliever within the past year I love the look of this set but couldn t afford the 4000 someone was asking on Amazon I have a lot of VIP points I got addicted quickly so I am really looking forward to November 27 Purple Dave November 5 2017 at 853 am Rev1964 I think doublepoints will only apply for Brick Friday Preview weekend which is a week earlier but there are two things to keep in mind when hoarding VIP points for large purchases 1 VIP points expire I think you get two years from the date they re earned to unload them or they vanish Oldest points get spent first so if you save them up to make one big purchase around the same time every year any unspent points will be less than a year old and will be the first to go when you make your next big purchase 2 Unless they re about to expire never spend VIP points during doublepoints promotions Points spent are deducted from the sale price before new points are awarded so for every 100 in points you redeem you ll usually miss out on earning 5 During doublepoints you miss out on earning 10 so buying during doublepoints and holding off on spending points until a later date will earn you more VIP points to spend Leave a Reply Cancel reply documentaddEventListenerDOMContentLoaded function   var

Germany built by Steffen Rau is simply breathtaking The architectural detailing and color are astounding and eyepopping with intricate features on the facade that look like it took some marvelously complex techniques to achieve that even an architect would be proud of The siding just below the roof which was most likely wooden gives a beautiful compliment in color to the red roof tiling and a nice con trast with the midsection in black and white The back of the building features the train tracks and a platform with minifigure commuters waiting for their train to arrive See more of this

sprawling scifi cities done on the cheap but it s also a great tool for recreating real buildings with a reasonably small number of pieces Brazilian builder Gilcelio chagas has done that with the Penha Convent  which is located in the Vila Velha region of Brazil Compare the build to pictures of the site and you ll see the effort that has gone into making this look authentic at such a small scale Make sure you also spot the clever used of an army helmet as the top of rounded tree and an alternate view that offers a better look at the build of the mountain that the convent sits on Like

scene from season 2 of The Walking Dead  I can still recall the sense of dread as the camera focuses on the small gap in the barn door and Sophia emerges from the darkness The barn itself is wonderfully detailed and weathered While the use of so many different grass elements along the edge of the barn conveys a sense of managed chaos as nature starts to reclaim civilization There are so many other details worth mentioning in this LEGO creation besides the barn itself The use of stalks of Technic connectors to form the gnarled tree the wire fence and the tractor are also great touches

there s even some chrome to look like a million bucks He also turned out Daryl s legs for a more natural pose Jonas s other Walking Dead build is a gruesome scene featuring Negan There are a lot of

walking the earth strikes me as completely ridiculous and I never got into the whole ApocaLEGO theme either but yet somehow I am completely hooked on The Walking Dead  I first saw an episode about two years ago and since have bingewatched the first four seasons and am camped in front of the TV for every new episode I can t really explain why Perhaps it s because some of the characters are so unsympathetic that the thought of a halfrotted zombie tearing their guts out is something to look forward to Nobody seems safe however and whenever the more likeable characters are killed off such as Dale Horvath in the 2nd season I feel pretty much gutted myself pun intended A lot of fanbuilt LEGO models based on The Walking D ead are focussed on customized minifigures but I wanted to have a

Halloween 1 Comment on You may not like spiders but don t you love the fear of spiders By the dragon s bones this one s a terror Builder Jayfa is a Bionicle and constractionsystem whiz and one of his latest technological terrors is this bone beast from the beyond The skeleton dragon employs rows upon rows of tiny teeth for the vertebrae and a marvelously sculpted head using largely classic System

villagers even dragons need a little down time Anthony Wilson has built one of the most distinguished chilledout dragons I have ever seen In his relaxed position this dragon is able to effortlessly enjoy a cup of tea without disturbing those fine Magenta wings and the floral decorations in his hair  I particularly love the use of the lime Gresh helmet for the dragon s flared nostrils and Corroder Claws to form the head shape A closer look at the relaxed dragon shows that he likes nothing better than a Jammie Dodger to dip into his cup of tea Milk and no sugar please he s looking after that fine figure I love the cute little teapot suspended from the tip of the dragon s tail while the cup and saucer really look the part Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest

alone Where is this bizarre LEGO creature heading and what does he hope to find once he gets there Only builder Vince Toulouse knows Described simply as the pilgrim  this alien creature is terrifying elegant and beautiful all at the same time While the overall design is rather simple it s the details and unusual parts choices that really elevate this creation For example did you spot the practical

worse sometimes life likes to surprise you Such is the case with this band of pirates as Dwalin Forkbeard tells us The pirates have survived an unfortunate battle with an Imperial ship only to be attacked by an ancient sea monster They are doing everything they can to escape going as far as blowing into the sail but will that be enough Judging by the skeleton on the animal s back they do not even have to be eaten to meet a tragic end While the textures are somewhat simple the inner construction of the creature has to be impressive to achieve the smooth rounded shaping The segment on the back resembling a small island is a common theme with sea monsters but I have never seen it done in LEGO before and a conservative amount of seashells and other sea animals spread across the monster really gives it a re alistic impression While the whale or is it a fish Is it any of that even is obviously the focal point and the best part of the build its surroundings help too  the raft is positioned so that it gives a feeling of action and the water spilling off the diorama looks just so dynamic Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Luka October 3 2017 LEGO  Models Creature  Diorama  Pirates Tyger Tyger burning bright Possessed by the fever to follow the call of the wild this magnificent tiger stops by the water to drink or possibly to bathe as one of the few cats who actually likes water Tigers are actually often portrayed in LEGO and we have even featured some in the past There is something about the tiger that makes it ideal for a great builder to show off their skills  the shape itself is somewhat difficult to capture but getting the colours right is a whole new level of difficulty Simon NH did not let that discourage him and has created one of the best LEGO tigers I have seen so far The shape is achieved with plates and wedges set up at different angles and some exotic parts rounding off the edges The fur on the chin and the rounding on the back are especially good The cat itself is great but Simon did not stop there Any good tiger needs a good jungle to go along with it  and what a good jungle Simon has made The plant life is unique and the ground colours and textures flow very nicely But my favourite part except for the build s focal point  the tiger obviously  is the water which uses many colours we do not associate immediately with water in LEGO but somehow it looks distinctly like it Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn

intimidating characteristics but interestingly enough this one by John Cheng would have none of that While the head seems a bit large the beak leaves no question as to what bird this build represents

Book  Creature  Instructions  Review The chirping of the birds announcing spring I am not sure whether Kai NRG lives in the southern hemisphere or not but spring is starting for some people out there and this creation of a mother bird feeding its baby definitely captures the feelings of the season Kai says the bird is some sort of lark but he could not get the colours of the feathers accurate enough There are some interesting part usages in the baby bird but even more so the elephant tailtrunk pieces used as the nest a requirement for the ABS building contest for which this creation was built I have mixed feelings about the tree though On one hand the leaves ar e understandably not perfect and the textures may be a bit too intense On the other hand though the very idea of building a segment of a tree in 11 scale and the complex shaping and angles involved are very impressive Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Luka

my name is Jonathan Samson and I am an addict This is the first post for The Brothers Brick that I ve written about one of my own LEGO creations One of the unfortunate side effects of writing for The Brothers Brick is that when you re immersed in the best LEGO creations the planet has to offer it makes one a little more picky about what classifies as a great build Most of my builds end up being dismantled before they are completed due to my perfectionist streak What do you get if you cross a Ralph MacQuarrie picture  a large LEGO collection and a crazy image you cannot shake from your headLet me present Batman vs Star Wars The Batlenium Falcon is loosely based on the Microfighters Falcon  but I made it a bit thinner completely rebuilt the cockpit and front mandibles and gave it bat ears I wanted to hark back to the classic Adam West Batmobile hence the red gofasterstripes Nightwing is amishmash of a few different microscale LEGO Xwings I ve seen crossed with the colours of Robin from The LEGO Batman Movie  Darth Joker came about because after building the Falcon I felt it needed more I had intended to build an explosion similar to the original image but instead opted for the cartoonish Kapow  floating fighting words to compliment the Tex Avery look of the Joker and as a nod to 60s Batman Enjoy Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit

Even though The LEGO Batman Movie has been in theaters since February LEGO Batman is back this summer with a whole new wave of sets Many of the sets this time around feature some of the more

 this time a mashup of the classic TVseries Batmobile and a fairground bumper car The chunky styling is fantastic with lovely colourblocking and stripes and a nice fat bumper running all the way round

communication for dealing directly with the Quality department A number of questions were submitted and here are the answers QUALITY ISSUES  COMPLAINTS FROM LEGO FANS 1 Instruction booklets come loose in the boxes They sometimes get damaged during transit If they were tightly packed in polybags it could prevent such damages Stickers also get wrinkled they could be packed with instructions A Yes we know and we have started to package building instructions labels and textiles in all sets with more than 1000 pieces in a poly bag The current solution is a quick and dirty one Version 2 will be ready within the first 3 month of 2011 2 Fans are having hard time choosing colors from instruction booklets Black and dark grey are especially very hard to distinguish A It is not only fans that have the issue All of us have The last 4 years we have tried to optimize this 2 or 3 times by adjusting the printing technique with no luck For 2012 second half products we will introduce an outline for black elements  cross fingers that it will help 3 Injection marks on transparent parts are ugly fans don t find them suitable for building Especially windowglass pieces require more attention about molding A There have been made some changes but give us an overview of the elements and we can verifyshow if they have been corrected 4 Slopes come with different surface textures Some are completely smooth while others have grain on them It would be better if they were standardized A 2  3 years ago we ensured that all roof tails have the same surface By an unknown reason back in 2003 the surface of roof tails was changed from rough to smooth All set manufactured the last 2 years should have uniform roof tails 5 Studs on certain parts are sometimes solid and sometimes hollow This should be standardized too A Sorry no A hollow stud are there either because we need that building function a tool for the minifigure fits on to the hole or because we for technical reasons cannot make the stud hollow from the back Look at the studs from the back on a plate The studs is hollow otherwise we cannot control the dimensions 6 Small tires are covered with some greasy material Dust sticks on them and it s hard to clean it A We need the grease in order to remove the part from the mould Yes it tend to be sticky and we are constantly trying to improve the materials used for tiers as they give other technically challenges 7 There is a major tone difference in same colors Dark red red and yellow are the most troublesome colors about this issue Also some pieces are translucent especially red ones They look too bright next to other parts in same color A We are constantly improving our colors and many improvements have been made the last 3  4 years Please judge the current quality based on set packaged the last 6 months and feedback on that as we want the right quality 9 Figure heads or torsos are problematic Some heads don t fit on some torsos they stay too loose a We need some examples and please do so in order for us to correct the moulds If you have any questions or quality issues that you would like me to forward on to LEGO feel free to do so in the comments If you have quality concerns try to be very specific Links to a picture help a lot If you have an issue with a particular part make sure you include the mold and cavity numbers from the element They generally look something like 31  This signifies the mold and cavity from which your part came It is a lot harder for the Quality department to look for problem if they don t know which mold or cavity is causing the issue Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Josh December 31 2010 LEGO Ambassadors Yo ho Haul together Forbidden Cove is proud

fun yet familiar daddy issues story with LEGO at its core Review When I first heard that LEGO was going to produce a movie featuring Ninjago I was flummoxed As an adult fan of Lego  AFOL  the entire Ninjago line fell outside my realm of interest when it came to building sets I hadnt watched the show played the games or even purchased a set outside of 70751 Temple of Airjitzu which I bought on discount one day because I thought it was a brilliant architectural model Saying that I had any sort of expectation to enjoy a press screening of The LEGO Ninjago Movie this past weekend would be a stretch Heading into the second LEGOthemed movie of the year I couldnt help but think the movie could use a bit more breathing room on the calendar coming only seven months after the successful run of The LEGO Batman Movie  This bias seemed confirmed by the sheer amount of marketing I saw for the film from Ninjagothemed obstacles on American Ninja Warrior to baking a LaLloyd cake on How to Cake It  all paid opportunities to promote the film If a movie needs to work this hard to get people to the theater the movie itself needs all the help it can get right Read our full review of The LEGO Ninjago

to the lineup which upon close inspection includes many interesting part usages including minifigure utensils as the fingers of the robot and minifigure handcuffs piece on Bumblebee s face The build

LEGO  Models Character  Clown  Horror  Movies New LEGO Star Wars 75192 UCS Millennium Falcon unveiled as largest LEGO set ever News The new 75192 UCS Millennium Falcon has been one of the worstkept secrets in LEGO s history with numerous teasers and leaks over the past several months However while the set s existence may not be a surprise we finally have all of the official details straight from LEGO HQ The new UCS Falcon will include 10 minifigs and clocks in at a whopping 7541 pieces comparable to the massive 7500piece LEGO Falcon built by Swiss LEGO fan Hannes Tscharner This makes the new Falcon the largest LEGO set ever released The set will hit stores on October 1st for 79999 and will be available early for VIP members beginning Sept 14 LEGO is sending The Brothers Brick an early copy of the set to review so check back soon for our full review of this enormous new set Back in 2007 I attended BrickFest PDX in Portland Oregon where LEGO Master Builder Erik Varszegi unveiled the original 10179 UCS Millennium Falcon  The original UCS Falcon was built from 5197 pieces So where do those extra 2500 pieces go First the exterior is considerably more detailed with a lot more tiles taking the place of plates along with many more rounded pieces that weren t available in 2007 including a new 4 4 quarter circle tile Second confirming the speculation among LEGO Star Wars fans the set also has several interior sections And finally another reason the part count is higher is that several details can be swapped out to turn the Classic Trilogy Falcon into the Episode VIIEpisode VIII Falcon with a square sensor dish and different details on the front of the mandibles The designer video with set designer Hans and graphic designer Maddy showcases many of the set s play features and design details and is definitely worth a watch Click through for the full gallery and details about 75192 UCS Millennium Falcon Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest

TBB FAQ Archives 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 Categories LEGO Models News Building Techniques People Resources Instructions Reviews LEGO Glossary History of LEGO Contact Us Search How to get featured on The Brothers Brick 2016 edition Editorial Back in 2009 I wrote a lengthy post titled How to get featured on The Brothers Brick in 3 easy steps  A lot has changed in 7 years for both TBB itself and on the web more generally and it s time we shared how we go about finding and selecting what to highlight here on The Brothers Brick in 2016 The three easy steps  I outlined back then are still 100 true Build something cool Take a few decent pictures Put them somewhere we ll find them But it s worth revisiting what we expect in terms of presentation and findability  I ll also cover what we consider newsworthy in case you have an event you d like us to feature or a hot tip you d like to share Build something cool I won t rehash what we think is cool We have a diverse team of contributors from all over the world and we all like different things  castles steampunk cars architecture airplanes spaceships Star Wars mecha  Read the website every day to see for yourself Suffice to say that if we think it s interesting we ll happily feature it Take good pictures Back in 2009 we mostly featured LEGO creations on plain white backgrounds  we ourselves jokingly called it the  Dorling Kindersley aesthetic  A clean white background does indeed focus the viewer s attention on the subject and we certainly continue to feature plenty of wellphotographed LEGO creations on the tried and true white background And it s not hard  just get some inexpensive cardstock set it up so that it curves up out of frame as a backdrop and plonk your MOC in the middle Moving away from the plain white background don t hesitate to get a bit creative Here I ve used nothing but a single piece of brown cardstock I ve tried a complex lightbox setup but have since just fallen back to big pieces of paper with plenty of lights Similarly the photography itself and subsequent postprocessing are not nearly as challenging as the process was back then Back in 2009 LEGO photo albums on sites like Flickr were still cluttered with blurry photos taken on handmedown cellphones These days photos taken on an a recent iPhone Nexus or Galaxy are pretty indistinguishable from photos taken on older DSLR ca meras And whether you re on a Mac or a PC there are plenty of outofthebox and free tools both for your computer and on websites to help you with basic fixes like cropping white balance and exposure There s really no excuse for posting a dark orangehued photo with your stupendous creation surrounded by huge expanses of dead space  you don t need an expensive digital SLR camera or pricy software like Photoshop All that said making the effort to take highresolution photos and postprocessing them a bit does make a huge difference Hannes Tscharner described the workflow he uses as a professional graphic designer with Photoshop in our interview about his Millennium Falcon  At the other end of the scale of technical aptitude I recently described how I used just the Photos app on my Mac plus a couple of free photo effects sites to create my Knights of Ren scene from The Force Awakens  The whole photo editing process took barely 10 minutes So good pictures on a good background  easy enough But we still see a lot of photos that don t meet the bar so here are a few things to avoid Bed sheets blankets and other fabric backgrounds These often look wrinkled and the texture of the fabric is frequently visible You can get cardstock at just about any craft or art supply store Top down Some builders try to avoid having random stuff in the background by taking their pictures from a high angle Don t Imagine you re a minifig yourself standing at ground level rather than a creepy drone flying overhead The great outdoors With rare exceptions reallife trees grass and buildings make your LEGO creation look out of scale and take the viewer out of the immersive experience of seeing your small creation as though it were fullsize That giant fusion furnace in the sky Strong sunlight can wash out your MOC and create overly stark shadows One more reason not to take your LEGO photos outdoors  at least on a sunny day Flash photography not allowed Whether you think your MOCs are great works of art or priceless artifacts they deserve better than blinding flash photography On the floor against the wall Like taking your LEGO picture in your back yard on your lawn the obvious humanscale floor and wall severely detract from your creation On the kitchen table We don t need to see your trash can and cat in the background Lots of text and large watermarks It s natural to want to indicate ownership of your photo but try to keep it subtle Bad renders Good renders of virtual LEGO builds are nearly indistinguishable from physical LEGO Bad renders look like the first attempts at CGI in the 1980s Share your great virtual builds with the world but don t expect us to highlight them if you haven t taken the time to render them well Help us find your great LEGO masterpiece In general we try to find the LEGO creations we end up highlighting on our own Most of what we write about we find through the LEGO photo pool on Flickr We also pore over dozens of other sources and we do check messages sent to us on our Facebook page and through our contact form  but if you want to be sure that our contributors see your LEGO creation share it in the main group on Flickr As with photography and presentation there are a few things we d ask builders to avoid A bazillion photos Pick just a handful of your photos and share only the best Include key angles like

spamming Contributors and the editorial team all talk amongst ourselves behind the scenes If we learn that you ve sent a bunch of our contributors identical or repeated requests to feature something you re liable to get an instant veto Cool it LEGO Ideas No we re not suggesting avoiding LEGO Ideas in general But please don t post your LEGO creations exclusively on the Ideas website and expect us to somehow find them there You ll get a lot more feedback by sharing photos of the creation itself on Flickr where you can link to your project page If it s a good project it ll naturally get the attention it deserves Facebook Facebook makes it incredibly hard to reference photos and information from external sites without being logged in Please don t host your photos only on Facebookcom and expect us to be able to highlight them here on BrothersBrickcom Brickshelf and MOCPages As much as we d love to see a LEGOspecific photo hosting site succeed this seems unrealistic today Sadly sites like Brickshelf and MOCPages both still operational as historical archives thankfully are no longer the hub of the LEGO fan community that groups on Flickr have become We truly wish it were otherwise but spending time digging up hidden gems on Brickshelf or MOCPages has no t proved fruitful for the last several years For better and for worse all this makes it that much easier for you as a LEGO builder to ensure we see your LEGO creation  just put it in the LEGO photo pool on Flickr If you ve done that trust us when we say that at least one of our 18 contributors will have seen it Extra Extra Read all about it As I promised we would in my 10th anniversary post last summer we ve made a number of substantive changes to improve TBB over the last six months Among them we ve significantly increased our coverage of LEGO news and LEGO set reviews  As a result we ve covered a lot more news items on The Brothers Brick than we had in the prior couple of years We still have a ways to go though and we need your help In addition to our own news hounds we also rely on our readers event organizers and even our friends and counterparts who run other news sites for tips If you see something LEGOrelated that you think might be newsworthy let us know by messaging us on Facebook or through our contact form  LEGO in the news See an interesting story on your local news Want to hear an AFOL perspective on something that s gone viral Let us know Events and conventions We d like to do a better job of giving LEGO fan conventions and exhibitions more attention but we can t keep up with the worldwide explosion of events  it s up to you as an event organizer to make sure we know about your event To keep things manageable we re happy to announce when registration is open and a reminder a few days before any public exhibition We typically won t post intermediate reminders like badge cutoffs MOC registration and so on Please follow the event information guidelines we posted back in 2008 LEGO product news In general we receive official set details and highresolution photos directly from our designated contacts in various departments at the LEGO Group However LEGO is a big multinational company and there are rare cases when things fall through the cracks and get revealed at conventions or other events Unlike lessscrupulous LEGO news sites I cannot stress enough that in mo re than 10 years The Brothers Brick has never been and never will be the source of underthetable leaks  Similarly we do not deal in lowquality rumors such as set lists or known confidential information like retail catalogs with watermarks But we are not LEGO Group employees and our duty is to you our readers If you see something elsewhere that you haven t seen us cover yet let us know Chances are we ll be able to get betterquality information directly from LEGO to share with you shortly afterward We hope this helps clarify how The Brothers Brick finds the LEGO models we feature what we expect from builders in terms of presentation and how we continue to work at improving our news coverage Questions Fire away in the comments Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook

While the Duffer brothers all thought they could get away with it  the internets would not let her die without a cause or fight Our very own Iain Heath has beautifully captured her likeness in the iconic pool scene It captures the essence of Barbs melancholy and at the same time the terrifying danger that lurks in the dark Catch Season 2 if youve not already done so were not planning on any

Letranger Absurde  Great use of the Mixel eyes to add character to Frankieboy s expression and all the requisite neck bolts and forehead staples are present and correct But the best bit for me is the extra angle added to the neckline of the tshirt It s little touches like that which separate brilliant models from good ones  tiny details which aren t required but are the mark of fantastic building

good friends I want my Mummy Tyler has been putting together a range of scary LEGO faces for Hallowe en this year Here s a selection starting off with an excellent bandagewrapped Mummy The shaping is perfect and the angled tiles as cloth strips work perfectly in this style The teeth look appropriately jagged and broken and those eyes peeking through gaps in the bandages are properly creepy This is one of those LEGO models which looks really simple but I bet took multiple rebuilds to ge t just right Tyler s also been kind enough to provide us with a drooling zombie  complete with cracked skull

dance off is a real thriller It s close to midnight and something evil s lurking in the dark It s LEGO Zombie Michael Jackson who definitely appears to have the soul for getting down I spotted one of those red hinges in a brick box and thought it looked a little like a leg An hour s building later and Michael appeared strutting his zombie stuff It s a simple model but I was pleased with the chunky cartoony vibe he s giving off  And just in case you missed it previously Hallowe en seems like the perfect excuse to remind you about LEGO 7 s amazing Zombie Michael  a model considerably more

of a good character Hellboy has longbeen a favourite subject for builders We ve featured our fair of LEGO Hellboy creations in the past But this version by LEGO 7 is an absolute cracker Built at a premium action figure scale this has poseability to match the fine sculpting Hellboy s horn stumps and massive right fist are perhaps the defining features of the character but this model faithfully captures other elements of Mike Mignola s creation  the coat with its long tails the defined abs and the Samaritan pistol I particularly like the beard and sideburns something hard to recreate at this

hear the word pirate  The figure is more than just a perfect depiction of a stereotypical pirate captain it is a great build combining complex angles in the torso a simple yet effective face

manipulated by the boy cracks me up On the other hand the fullsize Timmy in the Time Cruisers ad sort of creeps me out Enjoy Art Director Christian Faber tells us This was one of the first times we used 3D  the parking lot was built entirely in 3D and the man was shot on green screen I think the spot has something of a voodoo feel  the boy is controlling the cars remotely This spot is a bit different because the intro had nothing to do with toys Faber says The idea for this spot was inspired by Back to the Future  we actually built a Delorean for the set The 2D3D character animation was done by PDI and we shot in a plane interior in a Hollywood studio Naked Gun was filmed in the same plane It was a pretty chaotic set Faber says The shark here is a 2D animation shot on a 3D background  the models in the sharks mouth are real though This was a very simple line of sets and we felt we needed to spice up the communication hence the reallooking sharks We called it borrowed interest back

commercials News Advance has been making LEGO tv commercials for over 30 years and recently they rediscovered many classic commercials in their archives They will be releasing them online over the next ten weeks so look for them here with a bit of commentary from the people involved in their creation I am a big fan of vintage LEGO ads and commercials so I m pretty excited about this project Come take a trip down memory lane with Advance and The Brothers Brick Blast from the Past Trailer video Spyrius 1994 Art director Christian Faber says We shot this in London or LA I can t actually remember It was one of the first motion control spots we did At 015 We used a kind of magic building  technique where the bricks are held on the end of metal rods and then pulled apart And if you look closely at 000 you can actually see the edge of the studio in the top left corner The set filled a whole studio and we used a lot of analogue techniques  the planet is just painted cardboard and the backdrop is just a screen with little holes in it and a big light behind it The hands you can see moving the sets at 005 and 021 secs are actually wax hands I had quite a lot of explaining to do when customs asked why I had a bag full of fake arms  Technic Racers 1997 Faber says We shot it in a specially built 10metre tunnel that was handpainted and filled with smoke While it may look straight if you look closely at 0015 you can see the yellow lines bending slightly  that s because at this point we filmed the car in a carousel to make it look like it was speeding forward The animatronic hand was cast on a girl s hand so it was a perfect fit and gave her the control she needed in the more complicated movements  Wild West 1996 Faber says We juxtaposed stills of the LEGO sets being magic built  with lots of scenes from classic American Westerns The last few shots featuring the fight scene were filmed and then graded to fit in with the rest of the background scenes The magic building techniques shown here are actually illegal now  the law today requires that toy sets that need to be constructed have to be shown being built by hand Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook

is making the rounds on the web at this point most of you are probably already aware of the upcoming LEGO Friends theme in 2012 The response has been shall we say mixed Since I m sure there ll be quite a discussion here and elsewhere I won t shy away from sharing my own opinion Bottom line for me I m not a huge fan of the new figures but they bring muchneeded diversity to LEGO people and the sets themselves appear to be entirely brickbuilt with some interesting new colors For those of you out there who ve made statements about gender stereotyping take a look at this photo of set 3933

interested in building and to breathe fresh air into a toy category filled mostly with prefabricated play experiences for girls said Jrgen Vig Knudstorp CEO LEGO Group We focused on creating a play experience centered on the joy of creation while heeding the way girls naturally build and play We are incredibly proud of the solution we deliver with LEGO Friends and are resolved to build this

hold the same accessories can wear the same hair and headpieces and is compatible with all LEGO building sets A total of 29 different minidoll figures will be introduced in 2012 LEGO Friends is one of the most researched LEGO projects ever and is a culmination of years of anthropological research with girls around the world to understand what they expect from a construction toy said Nanna Ulrich

their unique desire for remodeling and redesign combined with realistic themes in community and friendship Unlike previous LEGO toys for girls LEGO Friends at its core does not apologize for being a construction toy and delivers for the first time a building experience in the same scale as our classic offerings Nanna Ulrich Gudum continued What LEGO Friends does differently is deliver the beauty

the Elves Netflix series and a bit of the official sets too the builder had the idea in her head for quite a while before amassing enough bright colours to realize it She notes that the diorama was a great opportunity to use not only new colours but new bricks too including many floral elements Angry Bird s eggs and all sorts of Elves and Friends decorative elements The cliff in the back is recycled from an earlier diorama  with appropriate upgrades of course The foliage is bright and colourful as are the cute little cottages  exactly in the official theme s style There are interiors built for all the cottages but sadly the buildings don t come apart to bephotographed This diorama was one of my favourite builds at the 19th Kockefest  the Slovenian LUG s display and many people I

LEGO  Models Castle  Lord of the Rings  The Hobbit No Comments on Living the rustic life alongside the Water in Hobbiton The birthplace of the European rebirth A builder that goes by the name Classical Bricks  Timothy Shortell  would probably find it challenging to choose a more appropriate theme to build in  there are few things more Classical than the Renaissance in western culture which Timothy is a part of His creation built for the Time Isles collaboration at BrickCon represents Florence the birthplace of the Renaissance The scene is bursting with the style and characteristics of the depicted time and place the buildings are packed tightly to give an impression of an old city but the buildings themselves are obviously screaming Renaissance too Arches ornate decoration and colours show us a rich city that was instrumental in bringing western culture to where it is today Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Luka November 2 2017 LEGO  Models Castle  Diorama No Comments on The birthplace of the European rebirth Padishah s plush palace LEGO builder Greg Dlx continues to explore largescale recreations of exotic architecture Following from last year s desert fortress  here s a beautiful Persian Palace The white and gold domes grab all the immediate attention but it s the arches with their fabulous purple touches and the surrounding greenery which draw you in further The vines snaking across the elaborate facade are well done and there s lots of nice tilework on the floors The surrounding gardens look beautiful and Greg has filled the grounds with a veritable menagerie of animal life However it s perhaps a shame there aren t some appropriate minifigures lending a little more action to the scene Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Rod October 30 2017 LEGO  Models Castle  MiddleEastern No Comments on Padishah s plush palace A harsh but satisfying life in the village of Avalon Four young builders join forces to bring us this extensive medieval village diorama While I often complain about lack of variety in topend castlethemed LEGO builds there is a very bright side to this if I had not known this creation was a collaboration I would never have figured it out The main image is hosted by Timothy Shortell  but the others involved are Micah the firebreathing hobbit  Mountain hobbit and Cole Blood  There are many details to see all over the diorama the market has many interesting elemets houses are all exceptionally done with interesting textures and angles everywhere and the plant life facilitates the time and place where this diorama is set up  dried grass autumn leaves and pine trees show us a cold but habitable place Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Luka October 27 2017 LEGO  Models Castle  Diorama No Comments on A harsh but satisfying life in the village of Avalon Deep in the forest in a hidden place The LEGO Elves theme has some of the most unique sets of recent years but we rarely see any custom creations inspired by this official theme There are exceptions of course and the exception we are looking at today is Sean Mayo s Fairy Tree House This build was set on display in the LEGO House s Masterpiece Gallery which may shed some light on the choice of theme Indeed if I had to choose builders to showcase their work in the LEGO House Sean Mayo would be very near the top of the list The focal point is obviously the tree with a quaint little house at the top both crafted masterfully The surrounding deserves some attention too the overgrowth is exploding with imagination The ferns are made out of grill tiles and the rocks while simplistic in technique work really well  it really shows how a top builder can make any technique look good My favourite part is the little boat though There are so many curves all over that give it a whimsical and organic look Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Luka October 20 2017 LEGO  Models Castle  Diorama No Comments on Deep in the forest in a hidden place Alright stop it s hammer time What better way to break up a featureless brick wall than with a bunch of hammers Letranger Absurde aka Vitroleum aka Pacurar Andrei  will have all the LEGO Castle builders sobbing into their mead with this neat wall technique  a texturetastic fortress constructed from Thor hammers However it s not just the tool use which makes this model stand out  don t miss the ingots on top of the crenelations and the shaping of the rockwork around the wall s ends This is small enough that I m going to call it a nice little proof of concept  I now insist on seeing a fullscale castle creation using this technique Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Rod October 12 2017 LEGO  Models Castle Castle s strength lies in its walls The Castle theme remains a perennial favourite amongst LEGO building genres This lovely model by Brick Knight shows why The diorama has a classic colour scheme with grey stone walls a brown and tan wooden structure and the obligatory red roofing However the wonderful details across the walls reveal this as a modern Castle creation rather than something from days of yore Whilst older techniques like stacked upsidedown 1 2 panel pieces contribute to the depth and texture and decorated shields provide a link to the past there s excellent use of the modern masonry  brick and a nicelyjudged scattering of hinges and 1 1 round plates to offer weathering effects I particularly like the use of cheese slopes to create the arrow slits and the lovely work on the stainedglass windows The castle sits in a nicelyrealised environment with a stream and enough trees to suggest a larger world worth exploring beyond the diorama s boundary The mounted knight is surely setting out on quest to do exactly that  There are fun details to be found all over the scene It s worth zooming in for a closer look I particularly liked this guard taking a bath in the stream his jerkin lying on the bank behind him  Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Rod October 1 2017 LEGO

Review Even if youve not heard of Chris McVeigh  youve probably seen his builds in one way or another especially his iconic Classic Mac thats been featured quite a bit across the media As a brick artist Chris specializes in capturing fragments of details in tiny builds that give maximum impact The other great part about Chriss builds is that all of his build guides are available free for download and all you need to do to enjoy his wonderful creations are to source the bricks from sites like Bricklink or gather what you have from your very own stash Of course there are those that may not have the time or knowledge of the secondary LEGO market to gather all those parts which makes purchasing a custom kit directly from the artist becomes a great option For those that do theres no detai l spared in the experience Trust me on this Im going to bet that youll be impressed by the level of care and detail that Chris puts into this Read the full review Like this post Tell all your

reviewed the custom LEGO kits designed by Dan Siskind of Brickmania  Back in 2013 I reviewed the Dodge WC54 Ambulance  and writing those reviews really got me started in building World War II models seriously In the meantime Dan and his team have continued to release new custom kits on a nearweekly cadence One of Dan s recent Brickmania releases is the M3A1 Scout Car  produced by the White Motor Company between 1940 and 1944 The vehicle served throughout WW2 and its basic design served as the basis of the iconic M3 Halftrack Like some of the custom kits I reviewed back in 2013 the M3A1 Scout Car is a WW2 vehicle I also built back in 2014 so I ll be comparing Dan s version with my own Click through to read the full review Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest

high tech After building two huge 116 Diesel locomotives one of which we blogged in February Dennis Glaasker  Bricksonwheels  has turned his attention to something rather more oldschool a Union Pacific 1941 Big Boy  steam engine Its scale is 138 based on LEGO s track gauge This is relatively small by Dennis  standards but the model is still more than 1 m long and took two and half months to build The engine can run albeit not on standard radius curves and to get it to run Dennis chose to include several custom and aftermarket parts The wheels and the valve gear and side rods were 3D printed by Jaap Kroon  JaapTechnic  The model is driven by three  Power Functions XL motors controlled through an SBrick and powered by a rechargeable RC battery pack To top it all off this behemoth is equipped with lights and electronics supplied by Brickstuff  Purists may be horrified by this cornucopia of hightech nonLEGO parts but I think it s hard to deny that the end result is impressive

is a rare beast among our tribe You may know Matt Hamann from his fine assortment of model engines and rolling stock or from his entertaining writing on the Twee Affect but youre about to know him much better I sat down with Matt on a bicycle made for two about halfway through the Wabash Cannonball Trail in northwest Ohio We talked about Los Campesinos Huffy vs Roadmaster and the persistence of chainslap The Build KG What is the most challenging thing about building trains Where do you stand on the classic 6 wide vs 8 wide debate and do you also pine for exotic track geometries and 9 volt engines like so many Trainheads MH  The most challenging thing about building trains is that you have to recreate something out of a building toy When building other themes that is not always the issue since you are working from concept art or your imagination unless of course you are building a scale model of a spaceship from a space opera or an all terrain vehicle from a movie about dinosaurs Modern locomotives have oddshaped details everywhere and w eird angles that do not translate easily into Lego steam engines had greebles everywhere and moving bits that the builder has to selectively compress yet still be able to make the model identifiable not to mention that most steam engines are matte whereas most Lego parts are glossy which adds another challenge But that is not to say that one is easier than the other it i s still a challenge to simply create something that is not yet another fighter ship or pile of grey bricks with a parapet gate and all your minifigs lined up perfectly in the courtyard I build 6 wide trains When I joined my Lego train club in 2006 it is what my club mates were building and what our layout is scaled to Bigger trains would just look silly among all the small buildings and cars and I am not about to start my own layout not in this decade at least Bigger models can also be more parts intensive which depending on the model s color and what pieces you are using can be more expensive than building a smaller models That point is especially important to me because I am for now a fulltime student with only a parttime job More and more I would rather spend my money on things other Lego like camping gear and stuff for my touring bike  so to build smaller less expensive models lets me keep doing both of my hobbies I also like to be able to pull about 30 train cars with just two 9v motors on unmodified wheels and transformers Power Functions is changing that but with the current system you can t beat light weight 6 wide trains if you are going for pulling the most train cars I won t say that building 8 wide is any easier than building 6 wide or visaversa if both are done right Building a smaller model means selectively compressing more but you have the convenience of a lot of train specific parts windscreens grilles etc that are mostly designed with 6 wide in mind If I had my own layout I would probably pine for a better system of track Right now I don t I know for sure that my layout wouldn t be 9v 9v is dead Power Functions is supposedly less expensive than 9v which helps keep Lego in business which keeps us AHOLs happy Power Functions also does not have the connectivity issues that 9v has Every little break between the tracks means lost current so on large layouts you have to have multiple power drops If I had the resources I would probably build my layout to be in scale with 7 wide trains  since they are the best of both worlds  KG Many builders claim that Lego is a great stressreliever Do you find this to be true and if it is why do so many people seem to get stressed about it so easily  MH I am melancholic when I build It feels great to be struck with inspiration to solve problems to finish a model and to get good feedback and have discussions with other AHOLs but since I am so anal retentive it can be stressful not to come up with a solution for a gap here or the funky dynamic brake blisters that GP7s and GP9s had It can also be stressful to source the parts that you need especially when they only came in a 50 Star Wars set from the mid 2000s and you need 20 when only 2 came in the set in a color that Lego doesn t make anymore That scenario seems to happen a lot With the financial involvement and the contrasting dogmas it is really no wonder that people stress out  KG Youve tried your hand at Steam Punk  but you failed to embrace many of its popular conventions Talk about the theme the good the horrible and what direction is ripe for exploiting  MH The popular themes among fans draw inspiration from everywhere Space builders draw inspiration from all the popular movies and series train builders from the world s trains and castle builders from history fantasy and mythology Lego steampunk seems like a giant circle jerk Instead of looking outside of their community of practice they have created an inbred style That is not to say that there shouldn t be common themes in the style but that there should be more variety Put away the parts from your Prince of Persia sets and your Jawa Sandcrawler and tear open those Power Miners sets that for whatever reason you still keep sealed and introduce some lime green to your build Steal some of the Scala and Belville that you gave your daughters and put some light yellow and aq ua your model Look to World War One and

published by Ustwo Games  In the game you guide the silent Princess Ida through mysterious monuments uncovering hidden paths taking advantage of optical illusions and outsmarting the enigmatic Crow People Described as a surreal exploration through fantastical architecture and impossible geometry it doesn t immediately sound easy to build from LEGO but that s exactly what qian yj has achieved The six main structures are colourful whimsical with an Escherlike  quality of illusion thanks to stairs and clever use of colour and angles Each structure appears simple at first but sections are not as connected as they first seem and there are some apparently floating areas within the builds  The apparently simple surreal structures are the attraction of the game itself  and LEGO seems like an ideal medium to transfer the art from the screen The closeup views of each structure can be seen in the builder s Flickr album but even better is this video showcasing the creations with a mix of LEGO and Princess Ida animation Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Elspeth De Montes November 13 2017 LEGO  Models Art  Sculpture  Video Game No Comments on Monument valley defies the physical brick Jump up and get down We like when LEGO builders take on the task of trying to recreate famous artworks or reimagine the styles of wellknown artists through the medium of brick Grantmasters takes on Keith Haring s iconic cartoon popart in this cool little creation I had to take a closer look to scope out the selection of curved black pieces Grant used to provide the signature outline to the red character  nicely done The strippedback colour schemes of Haring s work obviously lend themselves well to the LEGO palette and the collection of black motion marks  are perfectlyplaced to echo Haring s style Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Rod October 28 2017 LEGO  Models Art No Comments on Jump up and get down I ll take that Falcon with a splash of bricks Most people may not think so but LEGO builders really are artists in their own right The medium that they choose to express themselves in is simply tiny bricks instead of the traditional tools of oil and canvas that we see more often The traditional approach of interlocking these bricks is the expected aspect of it but a more unusual approach is the loose placement of brick s such as this spread by city son  This design is a breath of fresh air to the overdose that the Millennium Falcon is getting recently due to the largest set ever being released by the folks over at Billund plus a couple of major contests inspired by the venerable freighter What stands out with this piece of art is the colorful celebratory effect showcasing the Falcon in flight It almost looks like a splash of rainbow paint in popart style Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit

creations from seventeen different fan builders from all over the world French builder Samuel Pister has specially designed this fantastical monster for the display Samuel explains that the build is the story of a colourful monster who is confined in the display case and wants to escape The only language the monster speaks is modelling colours to express his emotions and he is trying to call out to visitors to help him The monster looks at the outside world with the face of the lime goblin and he tries to push up the display with the orange tree He is asking for love and touching the window with an aqua hand You might think that there is no way this monster can escape but by leaving a mark in the mind of the visitors engraving colours and leaving questions he will escape with them when they exit the house Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Elspeth De Montes October 14 2017 LEGO  Models Art  Colours  Sculpture LEGO collaboration is sweet and supercool At first glance these LEGO popsicles look totally sweet A collaborative creation by Carl Merriam  Niek  and Milan CMadge  the twin models perfectly capture the shapes of an icecream sandwich and a halfmunched orange popsicle or ice lolly  as it s known where I come from However regardless of how nice the models are you might wonder why it took 3 builders collaborating to create them Well it all comes down to the sheer scale of the endeavour Perhaps the image below will make everything clear It s only when the massive size of these models becomes

gallery Traditionally still life is the drawing or painting of items such as fruit flowers and household objects which are usually arranged on a table top Birgitte Jonsgard has crossed LEGO with a typical still life set up to give a still LEGO life piece of artwork that seems to emulate the work of Dutch Golden Age painter Pieter de Ring  The dark background and table contrasting with the

decided to commemorate their 25th wedding anniversary in this ambitious twoandahalfdimensional nonrectangular format After spending 100 hours digitally designing the piece Caleb then set about the arduous task of not only acquiring the 2400 odd bricks needed to build it but also addressing physical demands on the model that aren t apparent until a design actually gets assembled in the flesh  I hope this is still hanging on their wall when they get to commemorate their 50th At which time Caleb can no doubt recreate it using 5dimensional LEGO holocubes Like this post Tell all your friends

the top half of the Golden Gate Bridge due to the everpresent San Francisco fog But now I feel like I don t need to because Zio Chao has created an excellent photograph  of the beautiful bridge The builder uses forced perspective to his advantage to create a striking 2D image that really looks three dimensional And let s not overlook the little sailboat in the corner which only adds to the effect as it sails into the bay What really makes the illusion work is that only one of the supports on each gate is connected while the other one just floats a bit further back This gives the effect that the road is actually going through the supports and not across them Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Peter July 10 2017 LEGO

giant recordbreaking ferry built in Copenhagen Denmark not so long ago Now we finally got just the right bridge for that ferry to pass under LEGO Certified Professional Duncan Titmarsh and the rest of his team at Bright Bricks have brought to life one of the most ambitious LEGO projects we have ever seen With almost 6 million bricks 5805846 pieces to be precise this bridge became the biggest LEGO sculpture ever built  500000 bricks bigger than the previous record the lifesized LEGO Xwing revealed in New York s Times Square as part of the Star Wars Clone Wars cartoon promotion This bridge is about 13 meters more than 40 feet high and can easily fit two heavy Land Rovers on its deck The culmination of the building process which took 5 months was a spectacular opening show It featured some of the most prominent British celebrities including Bear Grylls in the picture above sailing Olympic gold medallist Sir Ben Ainslie driving the new SUV under the bridge and the British equestrian star Zara Phillips Some of the most impressive shots are in the video below The Bright Bricks team has also posted a great little animated making of  video to their YouTube channel  Like this post Tell all

The Great Western Brick Show take place in the UK at the STEAM Railway Museum in Swindon Some of the displays this year will mark the fact that it s 175 years since Isembard Kingdom Brunel opened his maintenance facility whose surviving buildings house the museum Jimmy Clinch has chosen to celebrate the occasion with a brilliant mosaic of the big man himself  Brunel is something of a hero of mine the most audacious engineer of the 19th century  a designer of tunnels bridges railway lines and enormous steamships He s a pinupboy for any selfrespecting steampunk fan and I would love to hang this mosaic on my wall I had a crack at building my own tribute to him a few years ago recreating the famous image taken in front of the SS Great Eastern  If you get the chance to make it to the show this weekend show your respect with a doff of the top hat to Jimmy s mosaic I m sure Isembard would appreciate it Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr

you imagine it being ornately decorated and having a long nose that sticks out in front of the cab The type of truck with a flat front known as a cab over isn t very common in the United States with the exception of light trucks used in cities In the seventies and eighties things were different however Many American truck manufacturers used to build cab over trucks with the Kenworth K100 Aerodyne represented by this great model by Maciej Drwiga  being a popular type Maciej is in the process of revamping many of his builds and this one isn t brand new but well worth having a closer look at It has a detailed chassis and engine  The dark red colour and the striping give it an eighties look and it looks the part of a work truck It does have the bells and whistles that you d expect on an American truck but without being overly flashy I also like seeing some exposed studs on the top Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Ralph December 30 2013 LEGO  Models Truck  Vehicle LEGO Disney Princess Cinderella s Dream Carriage 41053 Review Next up in the Disney Princess line is Cinderella s Dream Carriage coming in at 2999 and 274 pieces I admit I was really really looking forward to this one I was not disappointed The Build This build took three bags but only one instruction book The first bag was the fountain and bench while bags two and three built the carriage itself The fountain and bench are pretty straightforward The fountain uses four of the new heart jewel pieces The carriage was quite fun to build While not particularly challenging it does use the parts to shape itself into the round pumpkinish shape you d expect from Cinderella The Parts There are definitely some good things in this the gold decorative bit the heart jewels  and the new carriage wheels I am happy to report the silver filigree is printed onto the blue slopes Overall I definitely recommend this one It s a fun little build and the majority of the parts are useful bricks and plates with some nice printed slopes I am slightly less enthusiastic about the Cinderella minidoll as I prefer the Merida minidoll but I think overall it doesn t detract from the set Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Caylin December 30 2013 LEGO Disney Princess  Review LEGO Disney Princess Merida s Highland Games 41051 Review LEGO is expanding their Friend s scale lines with the addition of the Disney Princesses we reported earlier this year They ve started popping up in stores so keep an eye out We ll be sure to let you know when they are available online too First up is Merida s Highland Games The set retails for 1999 and comes with 145 pieces The set features Merida s home I think along with a tree a little water fall and a catapult of all things The Build Overall I can t say I m terribly impressed with this set There were two numbered bags and two small instruction booklets I am awfully confused as to the purpose of the catapult or why we re flinging the enchanted cookies about The waterfall and tree aren t terribly impressive but they at least make sense As far as the castle is concerned I just can t get behind lavender and tan as a color combination and it detracts for me The build itself is fairly simplistic Also the only printed things are the cookies the bears and Merida herself Everything else is stickers The Parts I think overall this set has a few good things going for it Merida herself is pretty fantastic The bears are simply adorable and everyone needs little printed cookie tiles The extra pieces aren t terribly exciting save for an extra cookie Ultimately I d recommend the set if you have someone in your life who is a huge Merida fan as this is currently the only set she comes in She and the bears are the only real standout parts to this particular set If you can live without her and the bears then I d say you re safe passing this set Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Caylin December 29 2013 LEGO Disney Princess  Review The Hobbit s Lake Town as it could have been I m sure many of you now have seen The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug or at have read the book It offers such rich locations and I m glad to see some start to crop up Lake Town

December 28 2013 LEGO  Models Diorama  Movies  The Hobbit The Miura is a red raging bull Italian tractor manufacturer Ferruccio Lamborghini was a man not to be messed with When he complained to Enzo Ferrari of the eponymous sportscar manufacturer that the busted clutch on his Ferrari was the same one as he used on his company s tractors and about poor service Enzo Ferrari famously snubbed him by telling him that as a tractor manufacturer Lamborghini couldn t know anything about sports cars Lamborghini set out to prove him wrong by starting a company to build the best Grand Tourer money could buy He chose a raging bull as the company s emblem Since then Lamborghini has become famous for its supercars and according to the guys from Top Gear  is the maddest car company of them all Senator Chinchilla has built an excellent model of one of the fist ones the Miura Jota Unlike Ferrari Lamborghini doesn t have a racing history focusing on road cars The Miura Jota however was a development of the road car intended for racing This explains the particularly unadorned look of the car when compared to the already very clean design of the normal  Miura The car never took part in a race however In typical Lamborghini fashion it crashed and then burned to a cinder during a test drive Most of the car models we feature are basically detailed sculptures with perhaps a few functions such as steering or opening doors I don t tend to blog pure Technic models This is not because I don t appreciate the skill involved in building them but for me it s about the aesthetic I prefer the look of system builds Senator Chinchilla s Miura has a beautifully sculpted body with opening doors and an opening clamshell engine cover Underneath the voluptuous curves lurks a Technic chassis with steering working suspension gearbox and a transversely mounted engine like the real car It combines the best of both worlds Thanks to Jack Marquez  Ewok in Disguise  for the suggestion Like this post

Contact Us Search Monument valley defies the physical brick Monument Valley is a beautiful puzzle game developed and published by Ustwo Games  In the game you guide the silent Princess Ida through mysterious monuments uncovering hidden paths taking advantage of optical illusions and outsmarting the enigmatic Crow People Described as a surreal exploration through fantastical architecture and impossible geometry it doesn t immediately sound easy to build from LEGO but that s exactly what qian yj has achieved The six main structures are colourful whimsical with an Escherlike  quality of illusion thanks to stairs and clever use of colour and angles Each structure appears simple at first but sections are not as connected as they first seem and there are some apparently floating areas within the builds  The apparently simple surreal structures are the attraction of the game itself  and LEGO seems like an ideal medium to transfer the art from the screen The closeup views of each structure can be seen in the builder s Flickr album but even better is this video showcasing the creations with a mix of LEGO and Princess Ida animation Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook

season 2 of The Walking Dead  I can still recall the sense of dread as the camera focuses on the small gap in the barn door and Sophia emerges from the darkness The barn itself is wonderfully detailed and weathered While the use of so many different grass elements along the edge of the barn conveys a sense of managed chaos as nature starts to reclaim civilization There are so many other details worth mentioning in this LEGO creation besides the barn itself The use of stalks of Technic connectors to form the gnarled tree the wire fence and the tractor are also great touches I also love the use of some fairly old wheel rims for the flatbed cart Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Daniel November 11 2017 LEGO  Models Farm  The

case with this supersized LEGO minifigure built by the criminally underrated builder Aukbricks  The creation while simple at first glance has some underlying complexity to it One such part is the elegant shaping of the arms which are shaped almost completely like the iconic minifigure arms Another very subtle but perfect detail is the slight curve around the top of the torso But there are more similarities between the original and the supersized versions than just visual likeness The giant minifig s arms and legs can move and its elements  can be taken apart like the real deal  and they

the Mystic Isles of Avalonia and was created from the imagination of LEGO builder Tirrell Brown  The tan and reddish brown colour combination fits well into the green woodland landscape surrounding the fortress I love the unusual circular construction with overgrown arches to give a really organic feel to the architecture Tirrell has clearly spent time on the trees and greenery to bring the whole build together resulting in a lovely vignette There s a story unfolding before our very eyes with the rowing boat arriving and someone awaiting the visitor s arrival I can t help but draw your

always fun to see a large city layoutAnd you will definitely not be disappointed by this bustling city scene by Korean building team OliveSeon  a huge minifigure scale diorama that is over 6 meters 19 feet in length The main central part of the scene includes a few official modular sets such as the Detective s Office  Parisian Restaurant and Ghostbusters HQ on the left But there is much more to this diorama than buildingsas I believe it depicts almost every form of transport system imaginable from an airplane to a suspension railway to HGVs and even a hot air balloon On the far right beyond those skyscrapers the concrete plunges into a chilled out beach scene and then a mountain peak complete with cable car The red and white cable car is very cute as is the hot air balloon even if every Health  Safety bone in my body is shouting that it s too close to the high wires  On the far left the transportation has a more nautical feel with the port and harbour area Don t go for a dip in the water on this side of the build though cos I ve spotted a few hungry sharks on patrol So can you think of any other forms of transportation the builders have missed in this huge 3part diorama Like

latest and most interesting LEGO sets and this year a movie too With the new year already having started in some parts of the world it is time for me to present the Top Ten LEGO reviews of 2014 Lego 21116 Minecraft Crafting Box 8in1 Review Our very own Chris was involved in the design of the first Minecraft set which made him the obvious choice for reviewing the first new minifig scale Minecraft set He wasn t overly impressed but that has not stopped the review from being our most popular of the year The world loves Minecraft Lego Ideas Exo Suit out today Review  Giveaway LEGO Ideas sets are featured pretty heavily in our Top Ten and the Exo Suit is one of the more original ideas to come out of it and one very much anticipated by adult fans of LEGO as opposed to mere fans of pop culture Peter Reid s design looked a bit too flimsy to work as a set but somehow the set designers pulled it off whilst maintaining the overall greebly look As an added bonus we had a copy of the set to give away to one of our readers The Tumbler LEGO Set Review 76023 What can I say Batman gets the coolest gadgets LEGO Ideas Ghostbusters Ecto1 Review The pleasure of reviewing this was all mine It s another Ideas set based on one of the funniest movies from the eighties The end result is a cool car with some very useful parts Lego Simpsons House 71006 Review Opinions on this set are divided among fans does LEGO really want to be associated with this dysfunctional family but Nannan liked it lots of neat details parts and play features at a decent price per part 70816 Benny s Spaceship Spaceship SPACESHIP Review Most of us at the Brothers Brick are old enough to have fond memories of Classic Space sets Benny s spaceship from the LEGO Movie ticked all the right boxes for Dan Full of sly humor the LEGO movie is a mustwatch for all Lego fans especially adults Review I know that many of us were apprehensive about a movie about LEGO expecting it to be a bit rubbish However Andrew liked it and I have yet to meet a LEGO fan who didn t Lego Star Wars 75060 SlaveI Review Depending on your view the Slave I is either one of the coolest or one of the weirdest spaceships from the Star Wars franchise Previous LEGO sets of this ship were relatively small but even though the new version is also intended for minifigs it is much bigger and far more detailed Lego Ideas 21110 research institute Review LEGO sets have been criticised for enforcing gender stereotypes I m not sure whether the Research Institute is a successful LEGO Ideas set because of this but Caylin certainly enjoyed seeing female minifigs in real life jobs that are fascinating engaging and fun 10242 Mini Cooper Review Last but certainly not least in my book is the Mini Cooper In the last few years car fans have been spoiled with excellent sets of classic cars and the Mini Cooper is no exception It s also full of very useful dark green parts All in all I think these are pretty neat sets Of course we do tend to pick those that we think you ll like In fact we are already poring over lists and images of sets that will be released next year so that we can keep the reviews coming Happy New Year everyone Like

highlighted the stellar LEGO Castle creations of Csar Soares three times already this month in fact but each one stands out as beautiful and unique in its own right Csar s latest building stands not atop a mound of highly textured landscaping but an incredibly thin spire The builds themselves deserve the attention and praise we ve given them but Csar also presents each with an enigmatic story told with carefully placed minifigs going about their little minifig lives Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Andrew December 30 2014 LEGO  Models Castle Gobbs the Brutalizer isn t here to be your friend Djordje found this fellow lurking down in the dungeons and I think that is where he should stay He really looks like he has earned his nickname but I really like the choice of colors on this character The black clothes make the orange skin really stand out and the purple mohawk makes for a nice splash of color The construction of the face on this guy is rather special as well The toothclaw pieces as detail bits around the eyes give this creature some real character Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter

present for her brotherinlaw who owns a Vespa Lucie has done a great job capturing the iconic look and feel of a vintage Vespa Her choice of scale is spoton as those complex slopes accurately mimic the clean lines of actual vintage Vespas and make this build really believable I have to say that I m rather jealous of her brotherinlaw Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest

until all hours of the night Anyway enough about me On to your questions Is the Lemur going to any conventions What conventions will be graced by The Brothers Brick contributors  I plan to attend as many conventions as I can this year Conventions are a ton of fun I don t know which conventions each of the contributors plans to attend but I m sure most of them plan to attend at least one Ralph tends to represent us at various British and European conventions though he has attended some conventions on the east coast of the US in the past I know Simon attends as many North American conventions as he can There is usually a large contingent of contributors at BrickCon and BrickWorld Keep an ear to the ground as your favorite conventions come nearer and we may have more information

2014 LEGO  Models Vignette Mighty morphin  masked motorcyclist Say hello to Kamen Rider  from the successful 70 s Japanese TV franchise of the same name This build is the work of Japanese popculture aficionado Moko  If it looks strangely familiar that may be because Kamen Rider was the inspiration for a certain 90 s American knockoff called the Power Rangers which confusingly spawned a spinoff called Masked Rider that aped the original show I love this piece not only because of its perfectly proportioned studless design but because it s just the latest in a long line of explorations of the masked rider by this builder going back as far as 2006 Though with this latest interpretation I think it s fair to say he s finally nailed it   Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter

year it being the 30th anniversary of Star Trek The Next Generation  Such as this minifig scale Type 6 shuttle designed by Jerry builds LEGO  which captures the lines of this iconic vessel perfectly thanks to deft use of some canopies probably from a Star Wars set I m not even gonna check I assume it s a Star Wars set since there s not exactly a shortage of those to choose from As an added treat Mr Builds With LEGO has even put together this neat instructional video showing you how to build one of these for yourself I like the format of this video in which each step is shown being built so you can easily follow along The video doesn t show which sets you ll have to rip apart to get those lovely canopies or how far you ll have to search to find matching STNG minifigs  that s an exercise left for the viewer Of course in the Star Trek universe transporters are method of choice for getting from point A to point B But if you think really hard about it they re actually just giant death machines and the entire franchise is just the story of hoards of people and their subsequent clones willingly stepping into oblivion So it s no wonder there a few characters in the show actually opt to travel exclusively by shuttle craft Slower and more tedious but at least it gets to you your destination without being bloody vaporized  Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter

contests that have finished CDATA aaxgetadmpb slotuuidec36c547d79f40abb41dd4cae0bfc13e   Announcing winners of The Brothers Brick s Millennium Falcon LEGO building contest News The Brothers Brick s LEGO Millennium Falcon building contest ran throughout the month of September with more than 160 entries large and small When we announced our contest we had no idea that LEGO would be running a Falcon contest of their own with the new 75192 UCS Millennium Falcon as their grand prize However LEGO kindly leveled the playing field between the two contests and the First Place winner of TBB s contest will also be receiving a UCS Falcon courtesy our friends in Billund Each of the four winners will also be receiving the superrare Escape the Space Slug  set In First Place taking home the UCS Falcon Josh Fowler built a largescale Millennium Falcon interior that depicts the creatures from the Dejarik holochess  game that Chewie played with Threepio but with the game s creatures playing with minifigs instead All of the judges agreed that the creative inversion of roles large scale and excellent recreation of both the Falcon s interior and the creatures themselves deserved our grand prize We asked contestants to submit only one photo as their entry but do be sure to peruse Josh s photostream on Flickr for more closeup shots like this one showing off the hilarious results of the game in progress In Second Place winning the current 75105 Millennium Falcon set from The Force Awakens plus a space slug city son used LEGO bricks to create what is essentially an Impressionist painting of the Millennium Falcon  We can only think of a handful of LEGO creations that use this technique to good effect and this is certainly the best  we just can t imagine transporting it to a show Click

Millennium Falcon  We are also extending the competition deadline to Sunday October 15th That gives you a whole month from today to dream up something really special so get building Any style scale or idea goes so long as it features the Falcon or something Falconesque in whole or in part For example it might be a rethemed version of the Falcon a movie crossover space battle or even a minifig scene

ever popular Castle theme With decades under its belt and endless great builders at its beck and call one can often feel a sense of dj vu towards even the most stunning of towers But this latest piece by Sergeant Chipmunk  gives the Castle theme something truly innovative and aweinspiring Focused on the peaceful side of medieval life Sergeant Chipmunk  depicts in one scene the complete construction of Hailstone Point  a unique tower sculpted entirely from frozen blocks Surveying the land extracting the ice transporting the bricks and carving the castle all eloquently done in one beautiful motion

Football  Sports Calvin and Hobbes  a LEGO Retrospective Today as many LEGO builders look back at their builds and accomplishments for the year I d like to go back a few more decades to December 31st 1995 The last published Calvin and Hobbes comic strip was published 20 years ago today and I thought it would be appropriate to take a look back at Calvin and Hobbes through the eyes of the LEGO Community and why we love them so much Calvin and Hobbes always held a very special place in my heart It was the first English book  I ever actually wanted to read But what surprises me is that  despite it being 20 years since the last printing  we still see LEGO builders from around the world regularly paying tribute to this wonderful comic strip In fact just over a month ago marked the 30th anniversary of the first Calvin and Hobbes comic strip and I built a little scene to commemorate the occasion I was quite shocked when I had someone message me to say thank you  for reminding them of Calvin and Hobbes and all the good memories Click through to see more LEGO Calvin  Hobbes creations Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn

Microscale SD Gundam Superior Dragon by Moko For my stocking this Christmas my wife included two adorable little SD Gundam figures she picked up at Uwajimaya here in Seattle They were all the rage back in Japan in the 80 s and I have fond memories of playing in the schoolyard dirt with adorably chibi versions of Guntank Dom Zaku and of course the titular Gundam RX782 There are about as many variations on Mobile Suits in the Gundam canon as there are stars in the galaxy and Moko has built the SUPERIOR DRAGON  character from the Gaiden storyline Notably Moko has used nothing but stock chromegold parts for his build  mostly the rare 1 2 goldchrome tiles that only came in three City sets back in 2003 Rather shockingly I think I see several chromegold C3PO arms for Gundam s fingers The dual lances can combine with part of the shield to form a bow and the wings spread out like many of the stock toys and plastic model kits Moko says on his blog where you can see more photos that he d been putting off building this because he thought getting the shape right with the very limited parts selection would be too hard But he also says he wanted to end 2015 with flair and I think he s certainly done so Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Andrew December 30 2015 LEGO  Models Gundam  Mecha Top 10 LEGO news stories on TBB in 2015 News Did you know that a new Star Wars movie came out in 2015 with accompanying LEGO sets If you ve been living in your basement working on your LEGO masterpiece and weren t aware one glance at TBB s top LEGO news stories would provide a clear picture of just how much excitement has preceded what turned out to be a rather excellent movie Like our roundup of most popular LEGO models of 2015  LEGO Star Wars stories have dominated news coverage this year  especially since the sets were first revealed in September The actual Top 10 list is heavily dominated by set announcements so hit the jump to check it out But some interesting and important news doesn t necessarily show up in this top 10 list Back in July TBB celebrated its tenth anniversary  and I reflected on what it s been like running a LEGO blog for 10 years I promised we would be making some changes to improve the experience for our readers and we ve done exactly that After BrickCon in October we added eight new contributors  who ve all helped us improve our coverage of both LEGO models and LEGO news We ve significantly broadened our geographic diversity with two new contributors from the UK both Scottish coincidentally and one each from Russia and South Africa  adding to our existing team from the US Canada and the Netherlands Our new contributors have helped to free up our editorial staff to focus more on timeconsuming content like LEGO set reviews  In other news Chinese artist Ai Weiwei s LEGO project generated some interesting discussion in the comments and several of our contributors participated in the annual Creations for Charity event Meanwhile TBB staff were also a strong presence at LEGO conventions such as Brickworld in Chicago and BrickCon in Seattle where readers and contributors built a rather epic American Civil War display in LEGO  featuring help from a corps of volunteer dinosaur cavalry And in the UK at BRICK  Elspeth took on LEGO Wonder Woman Click through

disappointed builder Swan Dutchman in the fact that it was only a facade and did not encompass the rest of the castle in the round  To fix this Swan built his own microscale version if we can call it that because the finished build is actually rather large It s built on top of a48 x 48 baseplate and contains around 3000 small pieces Big numbers aside and not even mentioning that it took three months to create this is a brilliant build that is instantly recognisable There s a lot of clever techniques such as gears used in the turrets for stone detail and the use of two different kinds of 2 x 2 round bricks Make sure you take a few minutes to soak up not only the castle but the builds around it in the body of water brick road and vegetation Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook

Princess Ida through mysterious monuments uncovering hidden paths taking advantage of optical illusions and outsmarting the enigmatic Crow People Described as a surreal exploration through fantastical architecture and impossible geometry it doesn t immediately sound easy to build from LEGO but that s exactly what qian yj has achieved The six main structures are colourful whimsical with an Escherlike  quality of illusion thanks to stairs and clever use of colour and angles Each structure appears simple at first but sections are not as connected as they first seem and there are some apparently floating areas within the builds  The apparently simple surreal structures are the attraction of the game itself  and LEGO seems like an ideal medium to transfer the art from the screen The closeup views of each structure can be seen in the builder s Flickr album but even better is this video showcasing the creations with a mix of LEGO and Princess Ida animation Like this post Tell all

with the game will see a very faithful recreation of a lorewise very important town in the recently announced expansion Mark has accurately built the fortified port town using over 55600 pieces The style of the game is captured well in the buildings  construction and the composition and shape is just like its ingame counterpart too as this screenshot demonstrates While the game s style belies the size of this creation those are standard green 32 32 baseplates it s sitting on which makes photographing this monster quite a feat by itself But in the end no matter how amazing the creation is

franchise but usually has little to do with spaceships The builder Evgeny Susekov  does not specify whether he took inspiration from the game or just from the faction s symbol  The builder uses every detail of the symbol s design to add something interesting to the spacecraft from the curves and side appendages to the unique diamond element in the center which is a cockpit connected by what appear to be energy beams The build is an interesting use of fantasy inspiration in a scifi theme However besides the shape there is not much more to remind us of the games and it might have been good to include at least an Orcish pilot or many many spikes Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Luka October 12 2017 LEGO  Models Space  Vehicle

uses a very pleasing colour scheme with nice contrast in its front prongs  not only contrasting in colour but in style too giving a barebone alternative to the otherwise smooth and streamlined areas

shapes and details are there from the supported black wings to the mesh elements on the sides of the cockpit My favourite parts are the thrusters as well as the Nexo Knights shield tile pieces used as

is half clean geometric lines half slimy LEGO tentacles Which makes complete sense obviously because according to the builder this is a Terran freighter corrupted by an alien species now used to harvest human souls Look closely and you ll notice a ton of interesting details such as the dual triangular exhausts the bright green Technic panel support beams and the proboscislike rudder filled with dangling ribbed hosing presumably this bit facilitates the soul harvesting Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Jennifer November 7

illustrates the most epic themes In this cool little diorama David Zambito depicts the early phases of humanity s colonisation of Mars Well at least I assume it s Mars because of the use of all those lovely dark orange pieces The TIEFighter windscreens make perfect domes at this scale and I like the stacked binoculars as refinery towers The tiny rovers are cool and the asymmetrical base adds a

for those now  While I haven t seen it yet the new movie Blade Runner 2049 does look quite awesome However I will admit I was a bit disappointed when I saw the new spinner sans all blueness and police lights to me there s nothing cooler than a white and black or blue in this case speeding down the road lights flashing sirens blaring Nonetheless Marius Herrmann has done an amazing job building the new spinner in LEGO form I love the unusual use of cut fiber optic cable as lights on the front nacelles The builder also managed to take a scene from the trailer and using Photoshop remove the real

details is now There are times when a LEGO creation is futuristic because it is a spaceship robot or another scifi element There are other times when the build itself is futuristic in its construction techniques and concepts This spaceship by Nick Trotta is one of the cases when these two aspects intersect LEGO creations keep evolving and advancing with time and this one is at the cutting edge for sure From complicated angles to unique solutions for round shapes there is a lot to see on this little spacecraft The best and most progressive parts though are the technical details like hoses and gears carefully enclosed by surrounding panels So many different colours would not look good in most cases but Nick has balanced them into a pleasing colour scheme For more inquiring readers the builder has a video showcasing his creation in detail Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Luka October 16 2017 Building Techniques  LEGO  Models Space  Vehicle 1 Comment on The future of details is now To move space cargo you need space freighters Freighters are a not uncommon amongst LEGO spacecraft but still notably less frequent than fighters  that is why they are always a welcome change from the usual militarized space genre This time we can thank James Zhan for the refreshment although the guns mounted at the side still hint at a somewhat violent universe The cargo crate s shape and texture contrasts nicely with the core of the spacecraft but I do wish James contrasted the colour too As far as the freighter itself goes it has a lot going for it The rounded shape while simply constructed is pleasing to the eye and the body is filled with different doodads and details to break it up without making it look too chaotic and scattered The car eful little hints of orange make an otherwise utilitarian colour scheme quite a treat too Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Luka October 13 2017 LEGO  Models Space  Vehicle A symbolic spacecraft for the Horde If you are unfamiliar with the source material for this LEGO model the Horde is a faction in the Warcraft franchise but usually has little to do with spaceships The builder Evgeny Susekov  does not specify whether he took inspiration from the game or just from the faction s symbol  The builder uses every detail of the symbol s design to add something interesting to the spacecraft from the curves and side appendages to the unique diamond element in the center which is a cockpit connected by what appear to be energy beams The build is an interesting use of fantasy inspiration in a scifi theme However besides the shape there is not much more to remind us of the games and it might have been good to include at least an Orcish pilot or many many spikes Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Luka October 12 2017 LEGO  Models Space  Vehicle

LEGO machines around Just a few week ago we highlighted his awesome LEGO ball maze that accelerates balls to 1000 rpm and he s already back having spent more than 100 hours designing another breathtaking creation This time it s an undulating wave of LEGO colors featuring 38 distinct swatches from LEGO s palette a palette that s changing over the years  Like Berthil sball maze this mechanism is designed to fit with the Great Ball Contraption standard fitting endtoend with other fans  creations for continual movement of LEGO s tiny soccer balls and basketballsBerthilltells us he was inspired to create the rainbow wave machine after seeing the vibrant rainbow of colors in the official image of LEGO s Creator XXXL Box  which he also used a source for many of the colored bricks The Rainbow Wave Great Ball Contraption uses about 1150 pieces and is powered by a single motor with each of the colored pistons sitting on an 8tooth gear Each piston s gear is exactly 1 tooth offset from its neighbors and this means the balls travel in a perfectly level line as they move across the waving surface Berthil says this mechanism took a lot of testing and redesigning to perfect in particular because digital prototyping with LEGO rendering programs isn t feasible for complicated moving machinery Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More

aaxgetadmpb slotuuidec36c547d79f40abb41dd4cae0bfc13e   Salvage your treasures from under the sea Imagine a future where the sea levels rise rapidly causing massive flooding to coastal regions and changing seaside resorts into underwater history Jonas Norlen has used this scenario as the back story to his latest LEGO creation Storken  a giant robot developed by the Coast Guard to salvage things from the bottom of the sea The Storken looks super futuristic with cables and lights aplenty albeit with a hint of comedy thanks to those gangly limbs The hovering Coast Guard helicopter above the robot is ideal to give a sense of scale and the same goes for the cute little truck in his hand and the blue tractor at his feet I particularly love the colour blocking used for the robot which gives it a very realistic Coast Guard corporate  feel Utilising a Storken to find the soap in the bath tub is definitely considered overkill Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest

look at this unusual LEGO mech by Chris Perron  The colour scheme may be fairly standard for a creation inspired by the Maschinen Krieger universe but the rest of it is beautifully odd The froglike legs have great functionallooking greebles and the splayed toes of the feet are chunky enough to look like they d keep this bad boy balanced The central pincer arm is well puttogether the twisted piping to the rear adds a biomechanical touch and the mech s face  manages to be both cute and eerie Best of all Chris has built an excellent base  lovely shaping nice colour choices and a fabulous depth of detail This is a cracking LEGO model wonderfully presented Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Rod November 2 2017 LEGO  Models Maschinen Krieger  Mecha No Comments on Onearmed frog mech on the march Make your own MaK  fresh off the sprue Surely even the most diehard LEGO builder has also dabbled in model kits Who hasn t spent time pruning the parts off a sprue and reaching for the glue Builder Andreas Lenander takes some inspiration from Peter Reids Turtle Robot kit and gives us the opportunity to put together a little hardsuit inspired by the Maschinen Krieger universe This creations is totally appropriate for MaK as the theme originally came about as a collaboration by kitbashers   modellers who would customise plastic kits into nearfuture creations Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Edwinder October 12 2017 LEGO  Models Maschinen Krieger  Mecha

the first to pick up arms or bricks is Marco Marozzi with this beautiful curvy bipedal mech The mech just oozes with Maschinen Krieger aesthetic From domes and curved surfaces to hoses guns and intense technical details It stands out even without considering the source material with an exotic colour scheme and unique shaping Marco really shows how to make a creation within some restrictions

designs of the individual lions may not be quite as detailed as you d like  presumably to save on partcount andor to allow them to fuse together The creator of the original Ideas submission Leandro Tayag offers this fantasticallydetailed Black Lion in mitigation The shaping around the chest and head are my favourite parts of this nearperfect creation There s a lot of little details that deserve attention too though The claws for example are made with only two pieces but still manage to look just perfect Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Clinton September 26 2017 LEGO  Models Mecha  Voltron A onetwo punch of pure mecha Sometimes LEGO mecha designs are based on existing concept art but occasionally they feel like their inspiration came from a particular piece or a certain idea for a shape These two mechs by Khairul Nizam seem to fall into the latter category The domeshaped heads and stout limbs are key elements in the design with the body widening towards the top to emphasise the curve of the cockpit cover The mecha are nearly identical in the design of their structural frame but despite their similarity each has interesting parts that make them unique This gives them each an individual character but also a sense of belonging in the same universe Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter

Tor this mech by zi zy looks ready to fight and win against anything that crosses its path I like the character that the builder has managed to incorporate into this build Its stout appendages flat

think that a man s best friend is WLY on the left although the look on his owner s face suggests he is not altogether happy with the ride The shaping of both droids is very cool with the new curved mudguards ideal to frame the face  areas SPD is definitely giving out arachnoid vibes with those spindly legs and seems to be the protector  being both armed and unmanned I love WLY s legs  ingenious

published by Ustwo Games  In the game you guide the silent Princess Ida through mysterious monuments uncovering hidden paths taking advantage of optical illusions and outsmarting the enigmatic Crow People Described as a surreal exploration through fantastical architecture and impossible geometry it doesn t immediately sound easy to build from LEGO but that s exactly what qian yj has achieved The six main structures are colourful whimsical with an Escherlike  quality of illusion thanks to stairs and clever use of colour and angles Each structure appears simple at first but sections are not as connected as they first seem and there are some apparently floating areas within the builds  The apparently simple surreal structures are the attraction of the game itself  and LEGO seems like an ideal medium to transfer the art from the screen The closeup views of each structure can be seen in the builder s Flickr album but even better is this video showcasing the creations with a mix of LEGO and Princess Ida animation Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Elspeth De Montes November 13 2017 LEGO  Models Art  Sculpture  Video Game

starts to reclaim civilization There are so many other details worth mentioning in this LEGO creation besides the barn itself The use of stalks of Technic connectors to form the gnarled tree the wire

daily post new stopmotion LEGO Star Wars movies You have to see them to believe them so head on over to LEGO INC and check them out for yourself The movies are in Windows Media WMV format so you ll

comicIchigou I highlighted Brickshelf user comic s Robonoid MOC a couple weeks ago promising to post must resist crosslinking about his Star Wars stopmotion movies Before I had a chance to do so he posted some really cool creations based on my favorite Hayao Miyazaki movie and lengthy comic book saga Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind  First up the fightergunship from the city of Pejite Admittedly the gunship is dark red in the movie but the shape is great Nice use of the canopy from Anakin s Jedi Starfighter Second the powered glider Mehve that Nausicaa herself flies I like the little Ohmu in the fourth image in the gallery as well as comic s use of the submarine bubble as the Ohmu s eye that Nausicaa gets from the forest My only suggestion would be to use this torso for Nausicaa instead of the plain blue one But maybe the plain blue works  I ve never entirely liked the Nausicaa minifigs I ve made myself  Overall great job Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter

a blog about breaking down barriers between LEGO cultures across the Pacific Ocean I thought a minifig from each of the uniquely American and Japanese themes would be appropriate Thus the cowboy and

technical sense Living in a giant candle winking at God Lighthouses are surely the most romantic of buildings  often remote surrounded by bleak rocks and crashing waves and dedicated to seeing mariners safely home Tim Schwalfenberg captures the haunting desolate beauty of a lonely lighthouse in this fabulous LEGO creation The almost monochrome colourscheme creates a melancholy tone only enhanced by the singular figure on the observation deck staring out into the night The subtle splash of yellow in the lamp and the suggestion of a beam lancing out into the fog are lovely touches The construction of the lighthouse itself is excellent with a sense of textured brickwork not often achieved in a single colour and a beautifully tapered cone Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook

combination of a fantasy universe with sets and vehicles that would work well with LEGO along with a strong storyline about good versus evil Jens Kronvold Frederiksen is famous for designing the UCS Millenium Falcon a product he created back in 2006 Designing the biggest LEGO set at that time under the Star Wars theme was very exciting for him It is no wonder it remains on his short list of favourite sets along with the Death Star which is a set he considers a family build  when an adult can help a younger fan to build a complex final creation He has a hand in lots of sets now as Design

camera focuses on the small gap in the barn door and Sophia emerges from the darkness The barn itself is wonderfully detailed and weathered While the use of so many different grass elements along the edge of the barn conveys a sense of managed chaos as nature starts to reclaim civilization There are so many other details worth mentioning in this LEGO creation besides the barn itself The use of stalks of Technic connectors to form the gnarled tree the wire fence and the tractor are also great touches I also love the use of some fairly old wheel rims for the flatbed cart Like this post Tell

of limitedrun sets and sold them at nonLEGO events like San Diego ComicCon Invariably the sets reflect highly collectable subject matter like Star Wars and Marvel super heroes We reviewed Detention Block Rescue the set LEGO sold at Star Wars Celebration earlier this year and we recently purchased the New York ComicCon exclusive 41498 Boba Fett  Han Solo in Carbonite BrickHeadz on eBay for 105 so we could bring our readers another review of a set you may not be able to get yourselves 41498 Boba Fett  Han Solo in Carbonite includes 329 pieces and while it was sold at the event for an already inflated 40 its original price during NYCC frankly doesn t matter  it s currently available ranging from 110 to 300 for Buy It Now listings on eBay and 112 to 145 for Amazoncom marketplace listings  This review in addition to providing a vicarious build experience for those not privileged enough to attend NYCC or able to purchase the set on the secondary market will discuss LEGO s business practice of releasing limitedrun products in ways that prevent most actual builders and LEGO fans from ever getting their hands on the set Click through to read our handson review of 41498 Boba Fett

youve probably seen his builds in one way or another especially his iconic Classic Mac thats been featured quite a bit across the media As a brick artist Chris specializes in capturing fragments of details in tiny builds that give maximum impact The other great part about Chriss builds is that all of his build guides are available free for download and all you need to do to enjoy his wonderful creations are to source the bricks from sites like Bricklink or gather what you have from your very own stash Of course there are those that may not have the time or knowledge of the secondary LEGO market to gather all those parts which makes purchasing a custom kit directly from the artist becomes a great option For those that do theres no detai l spared in the experience Trust me on this Im

early copy of a LEGO set to review receiving it a few days before it s widely available is generally not a problem We just spend a couple evenings building photographing and writing up the review  no big deal But when the new 75192 Ultimate Collector s Millennium Falcon lands with a resounding thump  on our doorstep two days before it s available to LEGO VIP Program members that s a bit of a different story TBB Senior Editor Chris Malloy and I have spent literally every spare moment since last Monday a week and a half ago slaving at the brick to bring you our handson review of the largest LEGO set ever released The new UCS Millennium Falcon includes 7541 pieces with 10 minifigs and costs USD 79999 That obviously makes it the mostexpensive LEGO set ever released and we ll address the price later in the review Fair warning up front that this review will be as much about the subjective build experience and our Gestalt perspective on the completed model as it will be about details like parts minifigs and building techniques We expect that many of our readers will not be able to afford an 800 set and we want to give you as much vicarious insight as possible into the endtoend

daddy issues story with LEGO at its core Review When I first heard that LEGO was going to produce a movie featuring Ninjago I was flummoxed As an adult fan of Lego  AFOL  the entire Ninjago line fell outside my realm of interest when it came to building sets I hadnt watched the show played the games or even purchased a set outside of 70751 Temple of Airjitzu which I bought on discount one day because I thought it was a brilliant architectural model Saying that I had any sort of expectation to enjoy a press screening of The LEGO Ninjago Movie this past weekend would be a stretch Heading into the second LEGOthemed movie of the year I couldnt help but think the movie could use a bit more breathing room on the calendar coming only seven months after the successful run of The LEGO Batman Movie  This bias seemed confirmed by the sheer amount of marketing I saw for the film from Ninjagothemed obstacles on American Ninja Warrior to baking a LaLloyd cake on How to Cake It  all paid opportunities to promote the film If a movie needs to work this hard to get people to the theater the movie itself needs all the help it can get right Read our full review of The LEGO Ninjago Movie

particular the Ninjago swords used in the roof to the far right Castor has also created a great selection of minifigures to populate the uneven grubby streets in front of the plush offices This is

only capture a little time Whilst we tend to like our LEGO purist here at Brothers Brick who doesn t like to see a bell jar put to imaginative use Peter Ilmrud does exactly that with a lovely steampunk chronograph packed into a small footprint inside a glass display cabinet The clock s design fits perfectly with the jar  both in size and shape and in its neoVictorian aesthetic Whilst the model is remarkable for the integration of the glass jar the resulting reflections in the photo do get a little in the way of seeing the details within Don t miss this shot of the beautiful

engines the ability to fly and advanced weaponry That s WNavarre s recipe for a truly original LEGO creation This could have turned out a hot mess of a build but there s enough colour and texture continuity across the model to pull off the ambitious intent The test of an unusual creative idea is Does it make sense without having to be explained  This model accomplishes exactly that  it s immediately apparent you re looking at a flying pirate castle ship What more explanation do you need The rear portion is excellent I love the integration of the engines and missile bay beneath the hull  Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Rod October 2 2017 LEGO  Models Pirates  Space  Steampunk Set course for sunset sailing amongst the clouds Builder James Zhan calls this a Steampunk Airship but it s unlike others we ve seen before The steampunk style can sometimes be little more than an overlay of anachronistic technology but this creation is stronger than that It feels like a realistic flying pirate ship  if that s possible James has a crew of Dwarven engineers for this craft which perhaps explains the chunky solid feel of the machinery on display A side view reveals the interesting cutaway section at the ship s centre giving a good view of the technical gubbins which serves to keep the vessel aloft Like this post

staples chequered envelope boatstyled gondola unlikely cannonbased armament that soars effortlessly somehow avoiding the risk of being grounded by genre tropes Whilst a sepiatinted image is de rigeur for a steampunk vessel this baby looks excellent in newfangled colour That red and black gas envelope is a stunner  the result of careful shaping using Mixel ballandsocket joints according to Thomas

island above an azure sea John Donne wrote that  no man is an island   but when it comes to LEGO creations famous poets do not restrict your imagination Ben Fitzsimmons has turned that saying around with his huge LEGO diorama depicting a multitude of islands each inhabited by wandering travellers Each unique little island is a place for rest and trade above the expanse of dark azure ocean This is a beautiful fantastical build with a touch of steampunk The islands are all full of creative buildings like the tall lighthouse on the far ri ght and nice landscaping such as the waterfall spilling back into the ocean and the colourful trees A closer look at one part of the diorama shows some of the fun detailsI love the propellerpowered pack that one traveller is wearing to cruise between islands while the use of the hot air balloon part  as a sail works well at this scale Ben s diorama won the Steampunk category at Brickfair Virginia this year and I imagine the build was even more

Steampunk Plunder the skies in your raid zeppelin Of all modes of aerial transport zeppelins are almost certainly the coolest possibly because they are the least common And while using one for raiding other aircraft may literally be the worst possible idea that just adds to the fantasy The sky pirates of The Travesty seem twice as crazy and intimidating for daring to raid aircraft in something as fragile as a zeppelin The build is somewhat simple using many large and specialized pieces but Ted Andes manages to bring it all together quite well I may be biased by nostalgia for the Adventurers zeppelin piece but I am sure the creation has something to offer for almost everybody The deck looks like it was just slapped together and hardly supports the clutter it carries which is exactly what one would expect from pirates The light use of stickers breathes just that little extra life into the creation to make it quite memorable and recognizable Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook

black piping makes for a pleasant change from the grey or gold steampunk builders tend to use for greebly details and those brown whips uncurled against the dark blue panelling look excellent The

illusion of scale However this bejewelled clockwork dragonfly by Duncan Lindbo is the exception to the rule The parts and colour choices here are perfect creating a wonderful impression of functional mechanical elements and a smart clockpunk aesthetic Displaying the dragonfly on a real lilypad turns out to be a stroke of genius highlighting the model s nonbiological nature and perhaps prompting

funny cartoon character and not the Venus de Milo CDATA aaxgetadmpb slotuuidec36c547d79f40abb41dd4cae0bfc13e   Monument valley defies the physical brick Monument Valley is a beautiful puzzle game developed and published by Ustwo Games  In the game you guide the silent Princess Ida through mysterious monuments uncovering hidden paths taking advantage of optical illusions and outsmarting the enigmatic Crow People Described as a surreal exploration through fantastical architecture and impossible geometry it doesn t immediately sound easy to build from LEGO but that s exactly what qian yj has achieved The six main structures are colourful whimsical with an Escherlike  quality of illusion thanks to stairs and clever use of colour and angles Each structure appears simple at first but sections are not as connected as they first seem and there are some apparently floating areas within the builds  The apparently simple surreal structures are the attraction of the game itself  and LEGO seems like an ideal medium to transfer the art from the screen The closeup views of each structure can be seen in the builder s Flickr album but even better is this video showcasing the creations with a mix of LEGO and Princess Ida animation Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Elspeth De Montes November 13 2017 LEGO  Models Art

escape of a colourful monster The Masterpiece Gallery in LEGO House has creations from seventeen different fan builders from all over the world French builder Samuel Pister has specially designed this fantastical monster for the display Samuel explains that the build is the story of a colourful monster who is confined in the display case and wants to escape The only language the monster speaks is modelling colours to express his emotions and he is trying to call out to visitors to help him The monster looks at the outside world with the face of the lime goblin and he tries to push up the display with the orange tree He is asking for love and touching the window with an aqua hand You might think that there is no way this monster can escape but by leaving a mark in the mind of the

What do you think of If you didn t say ABBA there s something wrong with you But here s a fabulous LEGO diorama from LegoJalex which manages to capture the era perfectly without a hint of the ScandiSuperTroupers We ve got an excellent orange Volvo 242 in the driveway but for me it s the surrounding scenery and attention to detail which make this model pop I love the textures of the different walls the use of forced perspective to create the buildings and factories in the distance and the little touches like the pail and the abandoned football in the grass The car itself is a smart model in its own right well worth a closer look  Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Rod October 26 2017 LEGO  Models Diorama  Town  Vehicle 1 Comment on Volvo  they re blocky but they re good Living in a giant candle winking at God Lighthouses are surely the most romantic of buildings  often remote surrounded by bleak rocks and crashing waves and dedicated to seeing mariners safely home Tim Schwalfenberg captures the haunting desolate beauty of a lonely lighthouse in this fabulous LEGO creation The almost monochrome colourscheme creates a melancholy tone only enhanced by the singular figure on the observation deck staring out into the night The subtle splash of yellow in the lamp and the suggestion of a beam lancing out into the fog are lovely touches The construction of the lighthouse itself is excellent with a sense of textured brickwork not often achieved in a single colour and a beautifully tapered cone Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Rod October 24 2017 LEGO  Models Lighthouse  Town No Comments on Living in a giant candle

furniture Good coffee is like good building  it s all in the technique Sometimes the use of interesting techniques or a lot of clever parts usage can overwhelm a LEGO model  distracting from the creation as a whole interfering with the design intent However this cafe model by Csar Soares manages to create an attractive and cohesive scene whilst being packed to the hilt with ultrasmart building techniques The brickbuilt signage and the lovely brickbuilt furniture might catch the eye first but don t miss all the surrounding textures It s worth zooming in to check out the tile roofs

wonderful clean and crisp lines which the builder says was inspired by the Dutch Modernist architect Willem Dudok  Sometimes these kind of architectureled creations can feel a little sterile I like the way Niek has populated the scene with numerous minifigures enjoying the pavilion facilities on what looks like a pleasant afternoon  The restaurant has an interior but it was the little touches

first glance Three different architectural styles  the legged  version that stands on the pavement cantilevered one at the corner and the typical setback type with smaller windows  represent the evolution of the city throughout the second half of the last century Moreover the diorama tells several stories of ordinary citizens For instance an old lady picks up unwanted paper boxes and cartons in exchange of little money while one of thousands of light trucks buzzing around the city is parking outside for loading And of course bonus points are for the retro road sign piece  which is out of

Princess Ida through mysterious monuments uncovering hidden paths taking advantage of optical illusions and outsmarting the enigmatic Crow People Described as a surreal exploration through fantastical architecture and impossible geometry it doesn t immediately sound easy to build from LEGO but that s exactly what qian yj has achieved The six main structures are colourful whimsical with an Escherlike  quality of illusion thanks to stairs and clever use of colour and angles Each structure appears simple at first but sections are not as connected as they first seem and there are some apparently floating areas within the builds  The apparently simple surreal structures are the attraction of the game itself  and LEGO seems like an ideal medium to transfer the art from the screen The closeup views of each structure can be seen in the builder s Flickr album but even better is this video showcasing the creations with a mix of LEGO and Princess Ida animation Like this post Tell all

heartwrenching scene from season 2 of The Walking Dead  I can still recall the sense of dread as the camera focuses on the small gap in the barn door and Sophia emerges from the darkness The barn itself is wonderfully detailed and weathered While the use of so many different grass elements along the edge of the barn conveys a sense of managed chaos as nature starts to reclaim civilization There are so many other details worth mentioning in this LEGO creation besides the barn itself The use of stalks of Technic connectors to form the gnarled tree the wire fence and the tractor are also

minisculehamlet has a distinct architectural style with blackcladlonghouses of a faintly nordicdesign From the palisade wall made of Technic pins to the longhouse butresses made of teeth and a crossbow Patrick has put all manner of elements to good use While the pickaxe as a tiny footbridge is quite clever and the scraggly wizard s tower made of robot hands looks appropriately sinister my favorite details are definitely the covered wagons made with halfround 1 1 tiles The grooved edges of the tiles fit perfectly as wagon bows under the grey bonnet and the tile s hollow underside gives

buildings Vesna Todorovi has struck gold with this Elvesthemed diorama Heavily inspired by the Elves Netflix series and a bit of the official sets too the builder had the idea in her head for quite a while before amassing enough bright colours to realize it She notes that the diorama was a great opportunity to use not only new colours but new bricks too including many floral elements Angry Bird s eggs and all sorts of Elves and Friends decorative elements The cliff in the back is recycled from an earlier diorama  with appropriate upgrades of course The foliage is bright and colourful as are the cute little cottages  exactly in the official theme s style There are interiors built for all the cottages but sadly the buildings don t come apart to bephotographed This diorama was one of my

faithful recreation of a lorewise very important town in the recently announced expansion Mark has accurately built the fortified port town using over 55600 pieces The style of the game is captured well in the buildings  construction and the composition and shape is just like its ingame counterpart too as this screenshot demonstrates While the game s style belies the size of this creation those

Warcraft s Theramore rebuilt in LEGO Building will bring you focus What better way to relax than to rake through the brick bins and create an Oriental pavilion At least that s what David Hensel appears to have decided David clearly felt the roof was the key element of this LEGO creation  and no surprise it s wonderfully detailed and a nice mix of colours without appearing garish That would explain the shallow depth of field in the photography bringing the roof into sharp focus and rendering the rest of the scene with something of a haze This coupled with the lack of minifigures creates a strange dreamlike atmosphere I like it Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Rod November 5 2017 LEGO  Models Asia  Diorama No Comments

appropriate theme to build in  there are few things more Classical than the Renaissance in western culture which Timothy is a part of His creation built for the Time Isles collaboration at BrickCon represents Florence the birthplace of the Renaissance The scene is bursting with the style and characteristics of the depicted time and place the buildings are packed tightly to give an impression of an old city but the buildings themselves are obviously screaming Renaissance too Arches ornate decoration and colours show us a rich city that was instrumental in bringing western culture to where it

the surrounding scenery and attention to detail which make this model pop I love the textures of the different walls the use of forced perspective to create the buildings and factories in the distance

Vehicle No Comments on Motorised LEGO version of Ken Block s Gymkhana 7 Smell the adventure in the jungle air There are many LEGO fans who grew up in the late nineties and at the start of the new millenium a time marked by one very unique LEGO theme Adventurers To me and I believe many share this opinion Adventurers seemed like one of those broad themes like space castle or pirates that just seems natural and should be present in one way or another With this in mind there see ms to be a strange lack of Adventurers creations online Recently this silence was momentarily broken by Joshua Brooks with his Diamond Falls diorama I was drawn to the diorama s theme and the official Adventurers logo in the top right corner of the picture More experienced builders will notice that the waterfall and the cliffs which represents a large portion of the build are somewhat simple in their design but that is more than made up for by the boat the overgrowth and the ruins hidden beneath it

LEGO community is an allaround friendly place and quiteopen to newcomers with very few exceptions What few realize is that this comes at a high price the comments exchanged by builders are friendly and positive  and often that means only positive And here lies a potential pitfall because honest critiques and seeming negativity tend to be avoided for fear of creating awkward situations Additionally not all builders wantto receive constructive feedback The end result is that most creations gather a plethora ofdry comments that do not really help the builders improve much I have been

the area safe from walkers The Tower looks just like the real thing and the detailed plants and garden look beautiful  I love the little wheelbarrow Using Technic wiring and minifighands as the barbed wire fence was a touch of genius and using it to hold up the LEGO cargo net as the fence is a masterstroke It is certainly holding up well against the zombie hordes Like this post Tell all your

creepy feel to this microscale LEGO scene  it seems that a little extraterrestrial tourism has led to a sudden drop in the population as if something untoward has left a rather full looking graveyard on the ground and a large not of this world  city in the sky Kale Frost has left the exact history of events to our own imaginations but the title After the Martians Came  suggests a postapocalyptic exodus from Earth I love the use of the stud shooter trigger for the headstones in the graveyard and Rocket Boy s rocket outfit gives a nice retro 1960s film feel to the scene A closer look at the ground shows that a surprising number of parts have been utilised to make this microscale scene The street lamp is cute and the damage to the streets is another sign that all is not well in town Like

scavenger mech called Bad Diesel who packs plenty of attitude and more than a little intimidation into his bulky frame I love the breathing apparatus and his ridiculously oversized weapon system There are a host of scavenged parts that help to emphasise his huntergatherer nature for example the  lobster sighting device  on the weapon or the round light tiles from the racing buggy sets as goggles You can see more of his scavenged equipment on show with his weapons system dismounted and on display Bad Diesel has plenty of poseability despite those thunderous thighs and heavy armour Like this

While not luxurious it is definetely the desire of any apocalypse survivor to find somewhere like this cellar to hunker down This particular palace  by Gareth Gidman was built for the Brrraaaaaaaiiiiinnnssss contest on Eurobricks The cellar section looks very livedin with weapons and sustenance positioned so it looks filled but not cluttered I should point out the use of broken tiles while not purist it is good that the builder found a way to still use his ruined pieces On the ground level we see some wellbuilt decay with a broken window overgrowth and cracks in the walls Some nice minifig action makes for a wellrounded scene As a side note I have seen brown pieces break much more often than other colours and seeing Gareth s broken brown tiles I am more convinced that this is statistically relevant Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Luka April 8 2017 LEGO  Models ApocaLEGO  Diorama  Zombies Smashing

a little about yourself and your relationship with the Brick Tim Sure I have found LEGO to be a great creative outlet when I need a break from all my calculus or physics courses While Ive been building almost as long as I can remember it wasnt until my first year of university that I started to look at LEGO with the intention of making anything beyond the rainbowwarrior spaceships of my earlier years Through a combination of some inspiring creations I stumbled upon through MOCpages and finding myself with too much free time on my hands I decided that to try out this LEGO thing more seriously Thousands of pieces and hundreds of creations later the LEGO hobby has become an incredibly important part of my life The itch to build has become a constant companion that is easily

fort and a flying ship While the ship does not look especially like a floating one it is unique enough that it does not look out of place in the sky The prison actually looks so nice it makes me want

albert might not have the impressive scale or detailing of some of the large pirate craft we ve seen but it s nicely put together all the same I love the wake effect built up from layers of different colours of transparent pieces and the mixture of tiles and studded plates to create texture in the water Personally I don t care for the tiled lettering I feel it distracts attention from the rest of

2017 LEGO  Models Microscale  Pirates We are all worms to the true tyrant of the sea When you think it can t get any worse sometimes life likes to surprise you Such is the case with this band of pirates as Dwalin Forkbeard tells us The pirates have survived an unfortunate battle with an Imperial ship only to be attacked by an ancient sea monster They are doing everything they can to escape going as far as blowing into the sail but will that be enough Judging by the skeleton on the animal s back they do not even have to be eaten to meet a tragic end While the textures are somewhat simple the inner construction of the creature has to be impressive to achieve the smooth rounded shaping The segment on the back resembling a small island is a common theme with sea monsters but I have never seen it done in LEGO before and a conservative amount of seashells and other sea animals spread across the monster really gives it a re alistic impression While the whale or is it a fish Is it any of that even is obviously the focal point and the best part of the build its surroundings help too  the raft is positioned so that it gives a feeling of action and the water spilling off the diorama looks just so dynamic Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Luka October 3 2017 LEGO  Models Creature  Diorama  Pirates Skypirate flying

truly original LEGO creation This could have turned out a hot mess of a build but there s enough colour and texture continuity across the model to pull off the ambitious intent The test of an unusual

quite clever Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Nick September 24 2017 LEGO  Models Diorama  Pirates Ta Davy Jones  locker with ya There is no doubt that William Navarre is one of the best and most active LEGO builders out there churning out build after build of great quality almost every week This one and his previous creation were built for the Colossal Battle Contest  This naval battle has a lot going for it the positioning of the ships is very expressive and dynamic not to mention how well they are constructed The scale is deceiving and the details are amazing  from the burning elements of the sinking ship to the rigging on the victorious side each vessel is worth looking at individually What I like best though is the surrounding wat er achieving a realistic look with two layers a top textured one and the bottom for colour and a great look from the side William s creations seem to have a theme of their simpler environment ending up capturing my attention even longer than the build s focal point  Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Luka September 16 2017 LEGO  Models Battle  Pirates  Ship Swashbuckling ship sails the seas Rather than telling the tale of the Curse of the Black Pearl  we have a new swashbuckling adventure to share the Attack of the Dark Bluish Grey Pearl  The titular ship has been beautifully sculpted in LEGO by Simon NH with some painstakingly intricate techniques for the hullSimon used minifigure hands to hold 1 2 tiles together which permits a great deal of shaping  check out that bow to see what can be achieved with this method The sails are also fantastic with plenty of movement and texture achieved with bricks Simon s favourite part of the ship is its stern so it is worthwhile taking a closer peek from the rear There sand green decorative fence and semicircular windows fit in perfectly I also love the use of the telephone handsets and Unikitty s tail in dark bluish grey Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Elspeth De Montes September 12 2017 LEGO  Models Pirates  Tall Ship A picturesque house with a noble goal This looks like a very pretty house in a warm climate but as builder Ayrlego explains there is more to it than quaint architecture

ComiCon exclusive 41498 Boba Fett  Han Solo in Carbonite BrickHeadz Review  Editorial Over the last few years LEGO has released a number of limitedrun sets and sold them at nonLEGO events like San Diego ComicCon Invariably the sets reflect highly collectable subject matter like Star Wars and Marvel super heroes We reviewed Detention Block Rescue the set LEGO sold at Star Wars Celebration earlier this year and we recently purchased the New York ComicCon exclusive 41498 Boba Fett  Han Solo in Carbonite BrickHeadz on eBay for 105 so we could bring our readers another review of a set you may not be able to get yourselves 41498 Boba Fett  Han Solo in Carbonite includes 329 pieces and while it was sold at the event for an already inflated 40 its original price during NYCC frankly doesn t matter  it s currently available ranging from 110 to 300 for Buy It Now listings on eBay and 112 to 145 for Amazoncom marketplace listings  This review in addition to providing a vicarious build experience for those not privileged enough to attend NYCC or able to purchase the set on the secondary market will discuss LEGO s business practice of releasing limitedrun products in ways that prevent most actual builders and LEGO fans from ever getting their hands on the set Click through to read our handson review of 41498 Boba Fett  Han Solo in Carbonite BrickHeadz Like this post Tell

contest News The Brothers Brick s LEGO Millennium Falcon building contest ran throughout the month of September with more than 160 entries large and small When we announced our contest we had no idea that LEGO would be running a Falcon contest of their own with the new 75192 UCS Millennium Falcon as their grand prize However LEGO kindly leveled the playing field between the two contests and the First Place winner of TBB s contest will also be receiving a UCS Falcon courtesy our friends in Billund Each of the four winners will also be receiving the superrare Escape the Space Slug  set In First Place taking home the UCS Falcon Josh Fowler built a largescale Millennium Falcon interior that depicts the creatures from the Dejarik holochess  game that Chewie played with Threepio but with the game s creatures playing with minifigs instead All of the judges agreed that the creative inversion of roles large scale and excellent recreation of both the Falcon s interior and the creatures themselves deserved our grand prize We asked contestants to submit only one photo as their entry but do be sure to peruse Josh s photostream on Flickr for more closeup shots like this one showing off the hilarious results of the game in progress In Second Place winning the current 75105 Millennium Falcon set from The Force Awakens plus a space slug city son used LEGO bricks to create what is essentially an Impressionist painting of the Millennium Falcon  We can only think of a handful of LEGO creations that use this technique to good effect and this is certainly the best  we just can t

At least that s what David Hensel appears to have decided David clearly felt the roof was the key element of this LEGO creation  and no surprise it s wonderfully detailed and a nice mix of colours without appearing garish That would explain the shallow depth of field in the photography bringing the roof into sharp focus and rendering the rest of the scene with something of a haze This coupled

teenaged builder William Navarre is no stranger to realistic historical Japanese themes but this latest creation of a company of samurai ambushing a camp of the emperor s ashigaru is one of his best addditions to the series There is much to see in this full LEGO scene from the minifig action that seems to express motion much better than one would expect of the somewhat motorically limited minifig to the flags and the realistic ground texture The background deserves discussion too while the opinions on the trees  textures may be variable the textures do work for what they are supposed to More importantly you should not miss the most subtle but also the most ingeniously simple part of the build the angled black background with dark blue rays of light penetrating the treetops Like this post

of a machiya by Dan Blom is a great example of a seemingly simple build that really looks the part The key architectural details like the barred window known as mushiko mado literal translation is insect cage window  and the wooden lattice faade are accurately represented These days most roofs are covered with clay tiles called kawara  and Dan has left the LEGO studs exposed to give the

most of you did too The gruesome scene of a human sacrifice s heart being ripped out is recreated nearly to perfection with cultists statues and rocky walls but most importantly a fiery pit that appears seething hot  an effect achieved not by clever lighting tricks but by building the light  onto the litup wall itself As expected of this builder the diorama is packed full of experimental

waste is another man s treasure Learn from a LEGO master at the Royal Academy There s a whole medieval world created by LEGO fan builders as part of a roleplaying game called Nine Kingdoms hosted by Germanlanguage site RogueBricks  Even RPGs need educational institutions and Markus Rollbhler has built the Royal Academy a place for students to come and learn from the masters There are lots of interesting LEGO techniques that we can also study at the Royal Academy with some fine LEGO construction and parts use on show My eye was immediately drawn to the tree with its foliage uniquely constructed using plumes of green feathers  I also love the bird s nest sitting on the roof of the Academy my ornithological knowledge is rather limited but it looks like a stork has made a home up there There are almost too many gems to mention as the Academy itself has some lovely architectural details such as the beautifully shaped dormer windows Can you spot the brown minifigure hockey

adamant about keeping the entire scene confined to those dimensions Later with the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull creations he relented and let some detail spill over and sometimes through the sides of the base John says aiming for consistency  was the unique challenge of a project of two dozen separate yet interconnected creations Click to keep up with the Jones s Like this post Tell all your

to produce and sell goats milk If you take a look inside the cart a good stock of goats cheese is being taken to market todayThis is a gentle scene that is both attractive and detailed with the cute

chance to see those cheeses being transported and some of the details in the front court and houseThere s plenty to love about this quaint scene but my eyes keep returning to the method of crushing

is an important part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and is even referenced in the title of the second book The Two Towers  The film version of the tower may not be quite as iconic as Sauron s Barad dur but it s still managed to burn itself into the memories of fantasy lovers all over the world This microscale LEGO recreation by Maelven isn t the first LEGO Orthanc model we ve featured but the builder has added a lot of great style to it Although quite a departure from this builder s comfort zone of highly accurate Star Wars vehicles Maelven did not disappoint in this turn to fantasy The intense details on the tower will keep your attention for more time than you would expect but what I really like is the gradual but very fluent tapering of the tower s shape towards the top  an effect achieved by slightly tilting many bars and plates on the surface of the creation Like this tiny Orthanc Check out this diorama of the breaking of Isengard featuring a 7 ft tall Orthanc  or a detailed

looking spaceships we all love and Sam Malmberg s contribution to the 2017 NoVVember project It uses a very pleasing colour scheme with nice contrast in its front prongs  not only contrasting in

cannot fail to turn heads as she cruises along in elegant style The curvaceous body is not something that immediately lends itself to being built from LEGO Technic parts but that is exactly what Martijn Nab has managed to achieve While the build is not an exact copy of one particular model I m definitely picking up a classic XK124 or 140 vibe with those bulbous front fenders With three

Stellar Recon Voyager in the USA Alec has rebuilt the classic 90s set very faithfully while keeping his own building style plainly visible The general shapes and details are there from the supported

from LegoJalex which manages to capture the era perfectly without a hint of the ScandiSuperTroupers We ve got an excellent orange Volvo 242 in the driveway but for me it s the surrounding scenery and attention to detail which make this model pop I love the textures of the different walls the use of forced perspective to create the buildings and factories in the distance and the little touches like the pail and the abandoned football in the grass The car itself is a smart model in its own right well worth a closer look  Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google

club s display Kockefest  a few weeks ago and can confirm it looks even more impressive in the brick  The cars were built in LEGO s Speed Racers style and the diorama scaled accordingly Primo has polished the model to perfection despite having to meet the deadline  a feeling well known amongst conventiongoing LEGO fans The buildings look realistic with just enough details to hold your attention but not to be overwhelming The cars themselves are excellent with all the right curves and proportions allowed by their slightly larger scale as opposed to the more limiting minifig scale

seen it yet the new movie Blade Runner 2049 does look quite awesome However I will admit I was a bit disappointed when I saw the new spinner sans all blueness and police lights to me there s nothing cooler than a white and black or blue in this case speeding down the road lights flashing sirens blaring Nonetheless Marius Herrmann has done an amazing job building the new spinner in LEGO form I love the unusual use of cut fiber optic cable as lights on the front nacelles The builder also managed to take a scene from the trailer and using Photoshop remove the real spinner and person from the scene replacing it with his own The result looks fantastic and could easily be mistaken for a real life setup Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr

Rudolph the radfuelled reindeer I have no idea if Mitsuru Nikaido s mechanoid LEGO reindeer is really atomicpowered but it would seem appropriate How else would a robotic ungulate have the sort of power and endurance to traverse the world with heavy sacks of gifts in tow The posing of the reindeer robot reinbot is excellent as is the level of greebly detail suggesting working gubbins and machinery Don t miss the use of minifig gun parts to create the antlers It s easy to overlook the sleigh alongside the mechanical beast  but that would be a shame as it s a great little build managing

better place for sharing your creations NewsEditorial Starting today visitors to MOCpages will discover a whole new set of available features to make the sharing of LEGO creations a more fun and interactive experience Going into the new year MOCpages has undergone significant changes following the suggestions of fans over the years The new features allow you to join groups and participate in discussion topics receive activity updates on your creations and from your favorite builders  explore the recent most popular creations and do much more  The new MOCpages has integrated popular features from sites such as Flickr Youtube and Facebook At the same time the website is still the only place where LEGO fans can dedicate a HTMLenabled webpage to presenting a creation The new comments system which previously functioned as reviews now allows for discussion of creations further enhanced by users being able to crea te a buddy icon for individualized identity The activities pages display comments on your creations new creations by your favorite builders latest discussions in your groups and more  MOCpages has adopted an explore feature that lets you browse the most popular creations of the day  week  and month  In addition you can sort through creations to see the most discussed ones and the most recent  Groups bring together people interests and creations You can create and administer your own or join others Also you can start discussion topics within groups host contests work on group projects and do more These are just a few of the many new features of the new MOCpages If you re not a user yet signing up is free And now for the brief editorial portion regarding the new MOCpages As someone who has been actively using MOCpages for its past four out of five years of existence on the web I can say that the new site marks the most significant change in the history of this community However in the course of the past few years MOCpages has acquired a negative image among some LEGO fans who have observed the quality of its showcased creations to decline and as a result many withdrew from using MOCpages and switched to sites such as Flickr Nevertheless there are still a handful of reputable builders who continue to use MOCpages for its unique feature to dedicate a customizable webpage to the display of one s creations With the implementation of the new features MOCpages gains characteristics that significantly boosts its previously lacked interactive qualities Will these changes be enough to attract prominent builders and more adult fans to its new community It is worthwhile to note the achievements of man running the show Sean Kenney  who singlehandedly maintained the website during all these years In the recent past Sean has been busy with setting up the new MOCpages and has made revision after revision to the site following the suggestions by the testers Having explored all the main features of the new website I attest that the new community is ready for its launch Sean has put down the potentials f or the new MOCpages to become an even more popular place to share LEGO creations it is now up to us builders to add our contributions In the course of the near future MOCpages will continue development and implement even more features The coming year will mark significant changes and growth So stop by and dig

Z was first introduced to the world almost 45 years ago and it still stands the test of time finding relevance to fans even today and mecha master Kelvin Low brings us a great Mazinger Z One cool thing to note is that this design is a rebuild of a previous version that employed a central frame from the Hero Factory system and now Kevin s overhauled it to a regular brickbased build What difference does that make Building with the classic system elements gives a cleaner look that matches the anime but at the cost of building to a smaller footprint as it becomes heavier with regular

built a microscale version of Tokyo  complete with rampaging kaiju While Marco Gan s microscale Tokyo is considerably less colorful it accurately captures the view of NeoTokyo seen in the 1988 Japanese animated movie Akira and Katsuhiro Otomo s original manga version that ran between 1982 and 1990 The monochrome cityscape is built on a simple blue baseplate but includes a density of detail from the bridge spanning the two halves of the city to a proliferation of landscape fragments To tie his build to its inspiration Marco also included a small backdrop with brickbuilt lettering spelling AKIRA  with pops of red reminiscent of Kaneda s bike  But it s not until you view the diorama from a higher angle that you discover Marco has also recreated the distinctive outline of the bay from the original comic representing a screaming human head Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Andrew April 10 2017 LEGO  Models Anime  Japan  Microscale Take the gold take it With a career spanning four decades Hayao Miyazaki holds a hallowed place in the crowded world of anime Maybe that s why it s impossible to go to any convention without tripping over Miyazaki cosplayers or wander through any store in Japan without stumbling across a Miyazaki aisle  But 15 years after it s release his Oscarwinning film Spirited Away remains his best selling and most popular work  and holds a special place in many a fan s heart The movie s character NoFace  has become particularly iconic and DOGOD Brick Designs brings us this beautiful LEGO interpration of the mysterious monosyllabic spirit Unlike a much cruder version of NoFace that yours truly built back in 2010 this version actually features a hinged action revealing Noface s

challenge The Jaguar Roadster is a classic car that cannot fail to turn heads as she cruises along in elegant style The curvaceous body is not something that immediately lends itself to being built from LEGO Technic parts but that is exactly what Martijn Nab has managed to achieve While the build is not an exact copy of one particular model I m definitely picking up a classic XK124 or 140 vibe with those bulbous front fenders With three colours to choose from Martin has managed to make a Technic Jag that captures the shape and feel of the real thing  Martin has added some functionality with

elements It does a look a little fragile at times with the whole structure wobbling away in the high speed turns but Im pretty sure builder Hoezer2 has got it all figured out and its gonna hold up The construction not only has the look and feel of a real roller coaster but the turns and runs actually have a top speed of 103 kmh 64 mph thanks to the use of Mindstorms EV3 motors and sensors I still

brick Monument Valley is a beautiful puzzle game developed and published by Ustwo Games  In the game you guide the silent Princess Ida through mysterious monuments uncovering hidden paths taking advantage of optical illusions and outsmarting the enigmatic Crow People Described as a surreal exploration through fantastical architecture and impossible geometry it doesn t immediately sound easy to build from LEGO but that s exactly what qian yj has achieved The six main structures are colourful whimsical with an Escherlike  quality of illusion thanks to stairs and clever use of colour and angles Each structure appears simple at first but sections are not as connected as they first seem and there are some apparently floating areas within the builds  The apparently simple surreal structures are the attraction of the game itself  and LEGO seems like an ideal medium to transfer the art from the screen The closeup views of each structure can be seen in the builder s Flickr album but even better is this video showcasing the creations with a mix of LEGO and Princess Ida animation Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn

beauty in a technical sense If you take too quick a look you could actually miss this unique placement of elements Allow your eyes to relax a little and your minds to open and youll start to see a lighthouse on a cliff with a boat perhaps lost at sea I wonder if David Zambito started out with the intention in mind or did a bunch of elements on the table almost randomly placed give him the

heartwrenching scene from season 2 of The Walking Dead  I can still recall the sense of dread as the camera focuses on the small gap in the barn door and Sophia emerges from the darkness The barn itself is wonderfully detailed and weathered While the use of so many different grass elements along the edge of the barn conveys a sense of managed chaos as nature starts to reclaim civilization There are so many other details worth mentioning in this LEGO creation besides the barn itself The use of stalks of Technic connectors to form the gnarled tree the wire fence and the tractor are also great touches I also love the use of some fairly old wheel rims for the flatbed cart Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Daniel November

this creation was built I have mixed feelings about the tree though On one hand the leaves ar e understandably not perfect and the textures may be a bit too intense On the other hand though the very

Vehicle Get tactical with a LEGO Black Ops II M8A1 Recently my favorite entry in the Call of Duty franchise  Black Ops II  was added to Xbox One backwards compatibility I picked up Treyarch Studios s 2012 vision of combat in 2025 again and felt inspired to build my favorite rifle in the game the M8A1 a rifle based on the real H K XM8  In addition to being inspired by the design of the gun itself I was motivated to build by the color scheme Most of the rifle in game is tan but its carry handle has a subtle bronze color I showed this color difference with two LEGO colors tan and medium dark flesh The latter color is fairly limited in parts selection which made its implementation a fun challenge Working features on the LEGO M8A1 include a moving trigger removable curved magazine and a sliding ambidextrous charging handle The tactical rail on the carry handle can attach a LEGO reflex sight that projects a red aiming dot onto a window piece I show and discuss these functions as well as a few techniques used to achieve the detail on the weapon in this four minute vi deo See more photos of the M8A1 on my Flickr  or check out other LEGO Black Ops weapons we have featured such as the PDW57

the panels is the number of teeth which the real dinosaur had much more of The build is approximately 55 cm long and 33cm wide which is a bit less than half the size of the 150cm long original Or

are no different in this respect morimorilego has built this rather traditional looking railway station with its bell tower and pleasing arched design using a complimentary combination of greys reddish brown and tan Every station needs a clock at the entrance to help passengers decide if they are late and require a last minute dash to the platform There are plenty of nice architectural details and interest with the main faade The Mansardesque roof and floral displays bring a touch of class to this building but those light stone steps will definitely be high maintenance on rainy days

At the end of the iron road Some classic LEGO themes are wildly popular but somehow feel underrepresented by custom LEGO models such as LEGO Pirates and Wild West  At least for the latter we have a new build to enjoy in this frontier train station by Marcel V With its unique roof and prominent clock the build looks almost steampunk but there are no fictional elements to be found There are a lot of interesting bits to see here The semicircular section s construction is quite impressive as is the roof itself The railroad tracks look very good done with a technique I am seeing more and more in fan creations And as a cherry on top Marcel has sprinkled the creation with all sorts of clutter from sacks and guns to the local wildlife  all of which breathes life into the scene Like this post

and sanding  a chat with Randy Sluder Interview Purists look away now as we go inside the mind of selfproclaimed LEGO outlaw Randy Sluder and see some of the innovative building he is doing around the LEGO monorail system Randy calls himself an outlaw because he s not afraid to cut drill sand and glue to create shapes LEGO never made However even he has lines he won t cross  he only uses genuine LEGO bricks and the same glue LEGO themselves use on their large display models TBB So Randytell us a little about yourself  Randy Im a graphic artist by trade and have always liked the Art Deco style so I gravitated to the Streamliner period of trains between 19351955 It was a time when form follows function  wasnt in vogue the emphasis was on great design And many people don t know that Art Deco train design was as important to the movement as the architecture TBB Where does your interest in monorail trains come from Randy All my life I ve been able to hear the sound of a train at night no matter where Ive lived and because Im a wannabe rail fan and a LEGO geek What started as a fun project for the grandkids has blossomed into a cottage industry In building a track for them I thought it would be nice to have a few more monorails In researching LEGO monorail designs I found most were childish blocktype designs with the better ones made from current LEGO train bodies Nobody was designing alternate vehicles for the LEGO monorail system So after a lot of interesting research I started creating trains for the monorail track Click to read the rest of the interview Like this post

thanks to perceptions created by movies like Wes Anderson s The Grand Budapest Hotel  I ve always thought that funiculars were somehow a uniquely European mode of transportation Although that s not actually the case they definitely have a certain Old World vaguely steampunk vibe  reinforced by the fact that many of them were first built in the 19th century Croatian builder Sven Franic has

quite as iconic as Sauron s Barad dur but it s still managed to burn itself into the memories of fantasy lovers all over the world This microscale LEGO recreation by Maelven isn t the first LEGO Orthanc model we ve featured but the builder has added a lot of great style to it Although quite a departure from this builder s comfort zone of highly accurate Star Wars vehicles Maelven did not disappoint in this turn to fantasy The intense details on the tower will keep your attention for more time than you would expect but what I really like is the gradual but very fluent tapering of the tower s shape towards the top  an effect achieved by slightly tilting many bars and plates on the surface of the creation Like this tiny Orthanc Check out this diorama of the breaking of Isengard

contrasting orange flames on the Balrog s back and his flamewhip even more striking The Balrog is an ephemeral creature wrapped in darkness and fire and the absence of explicit wings also adds to the

Learn from a LEGO master at the Royal Academy There s a whole medieval world created by LEGO fan builders as part of a roleplaying game called Nine Kingdoms hosted by Germanlanguage site RogueBricks  Even RPGs need educational institutions and Markus Rollbhler has built the Royal Academy a place for students to come and learn from the masters There are lots of interesting LEGO techniques that we can also study at the Royal Academy with some fine LEGO construction and parts use on show My eye was immediately drawn to the tree with its foliage uniquely constructed using plumes of green feathers  I also love the bird s nest sitting on the roof of the Academy my ornithological knowledge is rather limited but it looks like a stork has made a home up there There are almost too many gems to mention as the Academy itself has some lovely architectural details such as the beautifully shaped dormer windows Can you spot the brown minifigure hockey sticks in the scene There s a lot to love in this creation and if you like this build you will certainly enjoy spending a quiet summer evening at Markus  windmill  Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit

Mount Crumpit or possibly deep within Fangorn Forest Even with minimal and rather muddy landscaping this ramshackle LEGO house by Pieter Dennison is spectacular In addition to the wonderful curved

whimsical and woodsy cottage Nature lovers will Lovell this modernist home Lovell Health House is an International Style modernist residence designed and built by Richard Neutra between 1927 and 1929 It was built for the active healthconscious Lovell family in the hills of Los Angeles The houses construction is rather interesting In addition to the steel structure integrated with tension cables the house is actually one of the first to use gunite Mattias Sndergaard has captured Lovell House in LEGO form with its clean lines and overlapping planes perfectly suited to LEGO construction Whilst the house sits nestled into the cliff surrounded by nature Mattias has used some artistic license to give the natural flora of Los Angeles a New Hampshire  colour spectrum Like this post Tell all your

A palace fit for a minifigure queen Royal palaces are normally buildings with amazing architecture plush interiors and rich decoration and this LEGO palace is no different Built by Johan Keuterink  this huge modular palace has a few similarities to Buckingham Palace not just in its Neoclassical architecture style but also the two Royal Guards that the Queen has lent to protect the entrance Although the Baroque details will not be to everyone s taste the aim is to impress visiting heads of state and Johan s palace should certainly achieve such an aim I love intricate exterior street lights and the front door with some suitably impressive gold handles Johan has taken the time to ensure that his palace has a lavishly decorated interior  Donatella Versace would feel at home in this house The throne room is an example of the extensive details inside the palace with vast chandelier patterned floor and more gold than Fort Knox Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter

penniless When creating this digital LEGO model of three different buildings ukasz Libuszewski was inspired by the beautiful architecture of Prague On the right we have the pub on the ground floor and a museum showing the old town on the first floor There is a handy cashpoint just outside the pub so no excuses about running out of cash when it s time to buy drinks There is also a slightly abandoned looking tenement building on the left  it s definitely in need of repair Access to the lookout tower is via the central steps but take care as those shadowy stairs look a little eerie to me A view from the rear shows some of the interior design with the old town layout in the museum and some cosy looking tables and chairs all set up in the pub below I particularly like some of the architectural details such as the tan stonework around the window at the back of the pub and the use of the Elves keys in light blue grey within the lookout tower While this build is a digital build it has been beautifully crafted and although there a few elements that do not exist in LEGO s official collection it looks buildable in the brick  Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest

this fantastic mouse by Thomas Poulsom of LEGO Birds fame looks almost ready to scuttle off around your house in search of cheese I love the beady black eyes the pink nose and the way Tom has done the

Models Animal  Creature It s time to flamenco with a flamingo The word flamingo actually comes from the Spanish word flamenco which came from the earlier Latin word flamma meaning flame or fire The name seems all the more apt for this LEGO Flamingo created by BrickBro given that it s actually built from red bricks rather than pink The posing of this bird is perfectwith one foot characteristically tucked up whilst the other wades through the shallow water I love the dual purpose of the clear dish which firstly holds the bird in a standing position but also depicts a ripple in the water Those stick legs look just as fragile as an actual flamingo slegs This shapely bird has some clever albeit illegal  techniques in the neck area where the builder has used a short length of tubing to attach the tiles bottomtobottom The model is built only from LEGO parts however and stands surprisingly steady on that one little stick leg Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook

diorama Heavily inspired by the Elves Netflix series and a bit of the official sets too the builder had the idea in her head for quite a while before amassing enough bright colours to realize it She notes that the diorama was a great opportunity to use not only new colours but new bricks too including many floral elements Angry Bird s eggs and all sorts of Elves and Friends decorative elements The cliff in the back is recycled from an earlier diorama  with appropriate upgrades of course The foliage is bright and colourful as are the cute little cottages  exactly in the official theme s

Trossingen in Germany built by Steffen Rau is simply breathtaking The architectural detailing and color are astounding and eyepopping with intricate features on the facade that look like it took some marvelously complex techniques to achieve that even an architect would be proud of The siding just below the roof which was most likely wooden gives a beautiful compliment in color to the red roof tiling and a nice con trast with the midsection in black and white The back of the building features the train tracks and a platform with minifigure commuters waiting for their train to arrive See

car in a barn  Norton74 has put together an instantly recognizable scene in this LEGO creation depicting all the excitement of a treasure hunt The farm clutter is wonderfully deliberate and is immediately familiar to anybody who has driven down a country highway on the way from here to there From the wood piles and crates to the toppled gas pump And dont miss the hay stacked up inside the

November 8 2017 Building Techniques  LEGO  Models Cars  Speed Champions 5 Comments on I feel the need the need to burn some rubber The future of details is now There are times when a LEGO creation is futuristic because it is a spaceship robot or another scifi element There are other times when the build itself is futuristic in its construction techniques and concepts This spaceship by Nick Trotta is one of the cases when these two aspects intersect LEGO creations keep evolving and advancing with time and this one is at the cutting edge for sure From complicated angles to unique solutions for round shapes there is a lot to see on this little spacecraft The best and most progressive parts though are the technical details like hoses and gears carefully enclosed by surrounding panels So many different colours would not look good in most cases but Nick has balanced them into a pleasing colour scheme For more inquiring readers the builder has a video showcasing his creation in detail Like

selfproclaimed LEGO outlaw Randy Sluder and see some of the innovative building he is doing around the LEGO monorail system Randy calls himself an outlaw because he s not afraid to cut drill sand and glue to create shapes LEGO never made However even he has lines he won t cross  he only uses genuine LEGO bricks and the same glue LEGO themselves use on their large display models TBB So Randytell us a little about yourself  Randy Im a graphic artist by trade and have always liked the Art Deco style so I gravitated to the Streamliner period of trains between 19351955 It was a time when form follows function  wasnt in vogue the emphasis was on great design And many people don t know that Art Deco train design was as important to the movement as the architecture TBB Where does your interest in monorail trains come from Randy All my life I ve been able to hear the sound of a train at night no matter where Ive lived and because Im a wannabe rail fan and a LEGO geek What started as a fun project for the grandkids has blossomed into a cottage industry In building a track for them I thought it would be nice to have a few more monorails In researching LEGO monorail designs I found most were childish block type designs with the better ones made from current LEGO train bodies Nobody was designing alternate vehicles for the LEGO monorail system So after a lot of interesting research I started creating trains for the monorail track Click to read the rest of the interview Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn

sturdy as stone It s a bit strange when a LEGO creation is sturdier than the subject it represents Such is the case with this weathered hut by Grant Davis  which looks like a bunch of bricks were thrown together without proper connections and then collapsed immediately after being photographed That is most definetely not the case as Grant shows in his very informative video where he even turns the build upsidedown  and it remains intact The ground texture and colours should also be pointed out as the builder achieves a very realistic effect by using closely related colours in natural looking patterns Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Luka April 9 2017 Building Techniques  LEGO  Models Castle  Diorama Take the gold

complex storyline that accompanied the sets and most of the elements didn t integrate well with traditional SYSTEM bricks As a result longtime adult fans like the contributors here on The Brothers Brick never quite appreciated what Bionicle had to offer so most of the LEGO models we feature here on The Brothers Brick are built from traditional SYSTEM bricks Nevertheless we do appreciate a great

was chosen by Odin to wield magical steel to banish those corrupted by darkness If I were in the AllFather s place my choice would probably be similar The figure has lots of character with the Chima

didn t grow up with the classic space sets so naturally I was never overly inspired to build in the colour scheme and building style I did however grow up with classic Bionicle sets Having built a 11 Toa Onua replica a while ago I contemplated the comparison between the two themes as core nostalgic focal points of LEGO fans from different ages which gives this casual looking MOC some surprising symbolic depth Toa Enstau wasn t started with an intention to be a ClassicSpaceBionicle mashup but since I had borrowed a blue Hau kanohi mask and light gray is the easiest colour to build robotic details in Classic Space turned out as the only logical choice The build is based on my experience from my earlier systemstyle bionicle but since it is a completely original creation I had less restrictions in recreating details and shapes I realize the solar pannels don t fit very much in either of the stlyes but I still decided to use them as it makes for a more unique character and I personally like them The figure is well articulated but fragile There are more pictures of other angles and poses in my Bricksafe folder Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest

one of my creations that has been waiting for a few months to be uploaded for many irrelevant reasons I think this one takes a bit of insight to be appreciated fully While my build on the left is a servicable mechanical build on its own its true strengths can only be appreciated if compared to the original LEGO Bionicle 8532 Onua set on the right as this is a piecebypiece LEGO System recreation of the classic first generation Toa Onua set My version is completely unstable and unplayable but visually comes close enough to the official version that it passes my personal quality standard This was a somewhat quick build but I was so inspired by the idea that it completely took over my life for a few days It strikes me that Bionicle or as the cool kids call it these days bonkle  is quite similar to classic space in a way  while classic space is the most popular nostalgic theme for many older LEGO fans Bionicle is the goto nostalgia trip for ones growing up in the early 2000s which makes it surprising how rare reproductions are There are few even in the actual Bionicle building genre but besides my build I have only seen one other example of systemized Toa but even that was just the builder taking his own spin on the concept Now I have indeed built Toa Onua because this one is the easiest to build due to wide selection of parts in both of his primary colours black and very dark grey and I see myself being able to build Toa Kopaka but for any other ones my selection of parts just can not do So here is a challenge to any builder brave enough and equipped for it I would love to see more of the first generation Bionicle characters or later ones made out of system parts Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn

we do you can be sure they will be the absolute best of the best Such is this enormous dragon built by Yeonghun Joe  The builder loves dragons and it shows Two months of daily building to bring this monstrosity to life The end result is almost a meterlong and over halfametertall 10000piece masterpiece that has more going for it than just its size The dragon has great dynamic shaping and an intense texture throughout achieved with elements like wing pieces armor parts and shields To a critical viewer the wings may look too skeletal but I am glad Yeonghun did not use cloth pieces here as it might actually diminish the effect  and a brickbuilt solution would definetely be too heavy As for the head I am pleasantly surprised when I advise people on dragon building tecniques I tell them not to make teeth as they more often than not look bad but in this case and at this scale they look just as they should Creations made of Bionicle and related themes  pieces are usually poseable so I

Contact Us Search Tag Archives Miniland Miniland  is the name of the area at LEGOLAND theme parks where master model builders have created landmarks and cityscapes Built at a scale about twice as

Creator vehicles followed more recently by the lovely 10252 Volkswagen Beetle  Both these official sets are at a larger scale than LEGO s own Miniland scale which is the scale that TBB s own Ralph Savelsberg frequently builds his cars and trucks in Ralph s latest vehicle is VW s T3 Westfalia camper van complete with a popup top for extra head room when you head inside after a long day of drinking cold beverages from a cooler while sitting in your lawn chair Ralph makes extensive use of hinged connections and 1 1 cheese  slopes attached sideways to achieve subtle angles throughout the model from the section below the windscreen to the shape of the van s body underneath the sliding door Naturally the interior upholstery is a lovely checked pattern of orange and tan Like this post

today France is very very good at cheese fashion and wineand occasionally at engineering autos A legendary Peugeot 607 from the early 2000 s turned out to be good enough to merit being recreated with LEGO pieces somewhat 15 years later by Latvian builder Rolands Kirpis  If you re a longtime Rolands fan you re likelyused to his unique style of building which largely avoids curved slopes yet achieves a smooth look anyway The scale of the car is similar to the famous Miniland vehicles yet just a little bit bigger giving more space in the design for smooth transitions and some neat touches like pretty accurate mud guards Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Alexander June 26 2017 LEGO  Models Miniland  Vehicle Only the best care is given in this LEGO hospital The brickbuilt nurse is clear enough as LEGO but the room created by Kirill Simerzin begs a closer examination Overflowing with terrific details such as the slatted window blinds IV drip and power bed you can almost hear the quiet beeping of medical devices in this rendered scene of an Intensive Care Unit The larger miniland scale allows for lots of extra details

but members of a Russian LUG took it a step further and built their life with and without the precious brick for a recent LUG building challenge Over on the shelf we see that Timofey Tkachev s home would probably be filled with a mineral collection if he didn t have hisLEGO hobby On the right we can see what Timofey guesses his apartment would like without LEGO to keep him grounded There are lots of clever details to see on both sides like the carpet s edge and the LEGO shop bag nearly out of frame The figure also references the builder s previous creation  where we can compare what the

LEGO has released a number of limitedrun sets and sold them at nonLEGO events like San Diego ComicCon Invariably the sets reflect highly collectable subject matter like Star Wars and Marvel super heroes We reviewed Detention Block Rescue the set LEGO sold at Star Wars Celebration earlier this year and we recently purchased the New York ComicCon exclusive 41498 Boba Fett  Han Solo in Carbonite

at the event for an already inflated 40 its original price during NYCC frankly doesn t matter  it s currently available ranging from 110 to 300 for Buy It Now listings on eBay and 112 to 145 for Amazoncom marketplace listings  This review in addition to providing a vicarious build experience for those not privileged enough to attend NYCC or able to purchase the set on the secondary market

field between the two contests and the First Place winner of TBB s contest will also be receiving a UCS Falcon courtesy our friends in Billund Each of the four winners will also be receiving the superrare Escape the Space Slug  set In First Place taking home the UCS Falcon Josh Fowler built a largescale Millennium Falcon interior that depicts the creatures from the Dejarik holochess  game that Chewie played with Threepio but with the game s creatures playing with minifigs instead All of the judges agreed that the creative inversion of roles large scale and excellent recreation of both the Falcon s interior and the creatures themselves deserved our grand prize We asked contestants to submit only one photo as their entry but do be sure to peruse Josh s photostream on Flickr for more closeup shots like this one showing off the hilarious results of the game in progress In Second Place winning the current 75105 Millennium Falcon set from The Force Awakens plus a space slug city son

scuttle off around your house in search of cheese I love the beady black eyes the pink nose and the way Tom has done the ears And the whole creation is enhanced immensely by the short depth of focus

color are astounding and eyepopping with intricate features on the facade that look like it took some marvelously complex techniques to achieve that even an architect would be proud of The siding just below the roof which was most likely wooden gives a beautiful compliment in color to the red roof tiling and a nice con trast with the midsection in black and white The back of the building features the train tracks and a platform with minifigure commuters waiting for their train to arrive Steffen even shared a bit about the construction of the detailing and the techniques used for the upper facade It was featured as part of a larger display at the Museum Auberlehaus with a proper set of trains chugging along Trossingen is known to have one of the oldest electrical railways Like this post

outstanding creations in the titular theme with Tengu by the Belarussian builder Vlad Lisin as a prime example Vlad s theme for this round was feudal Japan and this samurai and oniinspired character has Japanese style to spare The menacing and muscular body gives a strong first impression and details like the bead necklace and sandals reward closer inspection In the end all that is overshadowed by the masterfully sculpted face with a glorious white beard and the yellow eyes standing out in contrast with the dark red skin Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google

realistic historical Japanese themes but this latest creation of a company of samurai ambushing a camp of the emperor s ashigaru is one of his best addditions to the series There is much to see in this full LEGO scene from the minifig action that seems to express motion much better than one would expect of the somewhat motorically limited minifig to the flags and the realistic ground texture The background deserves discussion too while the opinions on the trees  textures may be variable the textures do work for what they are supposed to More importantly you should not miss the most subtle but also the most ingeniously simple part of the build the angled black background with dark blue rays of light penetrating the treetops Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest

in the historical capital of KyotoThis LEGO version of a machiya by Dan Blom is a great example of a seemingly simple build that really looks the part The key architectural details like the barred window known as mushiko mado literal translation is insect cage window  and the wooden lattice faade are accurately represented These days most roofs are covered with clay tiles called kawara  and Dan has left the LEGO studs exposed to give the impression of neatly arranged rough tiles The addition of some extra little details such as the cart the various items outside the front of the house and

rampaging kaiju While Marco Gan s microscale Tokyo is considerably less colorful it accurately captures the view of NeoTokyo seen in the 1988 Japanese animated movie Akira and Katsuhiro Otomo s original manga version that ran between 1982 and 1990 The monochrome cityscape is built on a simple blue baseplate but includes a density of detail from the bridge spanning the two halves of the city to a proliferation of landscape fragments To tie his build to its inspiration Marco also included a small backdrop with brickbuilt lettering spelling AKIRA  with pops of red reminiscent of Kaneda s bike  But it s not until you view the diorama from a higher angle that you discover Marco has also recreated the distinctive outline of the bay from the original comic representing a screaming human

spectacularlycustomized trucks ply roadways and highways from Sapporo to Kagoshima and Lasse has reproduced the bright chrome and lights of these unique vehicles with pearlgold LEGO tiles and plenty of transclear 1 1 plates The truck is excellent but the school girls and truck driver are noteworthy as well built at a unique scale that lends itself to good details and articulation despite the

W Navarre  while simple hides a deeper complexity in the construction of the hut and rockwork under it but most notably the build has great atmosphere and a unique theme On such a small scale using many colours can be very risky which is why I am happy the builder only used as many as he needed to There is more to the build than only that seen on Navarre s Flickr page as he shares a few more vignettes on MOCpages  including a temple and a juice pressing structure While it is not accompanied by a story as most of Navarre s creations are it leaves more to the imagination It was built as

LinkedIn Caylin April 2 2016 LEGO  News BrickCon  Convention A thousand minifigs in Blue  Gray assemble for the Battle of Bricksburg News History is rarely accurate when written at the time The first comprehensive History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire wasn t published until 1776 and William L Shirer s The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich wasn t published until 15 years after the end of World War II And so it goes with the great Battle of Bricksburg which took place October 14 at BrickCon in Seattle this year Now nearly three months later thanks to the intrepid battlefield photography of Sean Edmison  we have an unprecedented view of this historic engagement between the Union and the Confederacy The idea for the Battle of Bricksburg was conceived during BrickCon 2014 We envisioned a realistic historical contrast to our many years of scifi displays such as the original Zombie Apocafest 2008 and Numereji 2421  In the end about a dozen TBB readers and staff members participated in building a cohesive display that was assembled from individual segments as well as loose brick in the two days before the public exhibition hours on Saturday and Sunday The display featured about a thousand troops including cavalry sharpshooters supply trains medical corps and even a pair of ironclads on the nearby river Union troops charge forward in front of an 1800 s farmhouse built by Caylin  Another group of Union soldiers has captured some Rebels Our friends over at Beyond the Brick produced a video overview of the display in which I describe some of the display s highlights and show off details like the BrickArms stackable cannon balls that are hard to see in photos Particular thanks go to Will Chapman of BrickArms  who supplied huge quantities of stackable cannonballs cannon muzzles caplock muskets by the thousand in gallon bags bayonets cavalry sabers and pistols We would not have been able to achieve the level of historical realism in the display without these accessories many of which Will customdesigned and injection molded in small batches by hand just for this display Similarly we relied on historical flags and unit banners printed

Please note that we cannot accept dropoffs during the public hours on Saturday and Sunday Following the custom sonic screwdrivers he made for ChronoCon last year we re incredibly grateful to Will Chapman from BrickArms for collaborating with us on a number of specially designed custom accessories for our display Planned accessories pending finalization include Stackable cannonballs Caplock musket Cavalry saber To start getting your minifigs properly equipped you can pick up the BrickArms Caplock Musket from Brickmania where you can also buy a really excellent M1857 cannon used by both sides during the war Both US and Confederate flags are available from our friend Dave Ingraham over at Cape Madness along with other cloth accessories like great coats Even though we re targeting a certain level of historical accuracy the display isn t trying to reproduce a specific battle or a specific location To help make this a success for everyone we ve designed the layout so that it can be as large or as small as it needs to be and can accommodate nearly whatever you build Whether you bring just a few infantry a squadron of cavalry big hulking ironclads houses for the town or a full section of landscaping we ll do our best to incorporate your hard work Nevertheless BrickCon organizers need to have a sense of how much space the display will need so please register your MOCs  after

to your favourite song if you don t need to put in the effort of carrying a large clumsy box around everywhere This retro 80 s radio by Chris McVeight captures that longgone era well with multiple realistic functions like a flipup handle and exchangable cassettes with a working ejecting mechanism There are some nonfunctional elements here that make for great details too most notably the seamless speakers and the great tuning display While nonLEGO elements are generally a detrement to a LEGO photo 11 scale creations are an exception to that rule Chris  addition of 80 slooking

Brickmania Track Links roll into production Review Last May Dan Siskind of Brickmania launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the production of a new kind of track elements designed to work with LEGO Early this year my backer reward package arrived and I ve been building and rebuilding furiously ever since My new M4A1 Sherman with a dozer attachment is typical of the engineering vehicles used during the invasion of Normandy with deep wading snorkels that enabled the tank to be dropped off farther from shore and drive mostly underwater on the sea floor I think Dan s design for his earlyproduction M4 Sherman turret can t be improved so I replicated his turret design while adding my own gun barrel for consistency with the rest of my tanks Both the M4A3 on the left and the dozer tank use twowide Track Links while the M4A3E2 Sherman Jumbo  on the right uses official threewide LEGO tracks In order to switch the M4A3 with the short 75mm gun barrel from its existing threewide LEGO track to Track Links I had to rebuild the suspension As a result I don t think this version  possibly my last  shares more than a few bricks with my original attempt at a Sherman that I first posted nearly four years ago LEGO currently produces three types of elements that builders use as tank treads and all of them are hard to get in any significant quantity and thus fairly expensive For those of us who build historical or realworld LEGO models each of these also has unique problems Onewide Technic chain link  The open chain links don t look a whole lot like actual tank treads Threewide Technic tread  The best official LEGO option for many tanks but three studs wide is one stud too many for most American tanks of World War II Fivewide tread with Technic pin holes  Far too huge for anything most minifigscale applications The most significant gap in available parts is the lack of any official twowide track Using two parallel sets of Technic chain link as I did on my M7 Priest  is costprohibitive at best and doesn t look all that great From a historical standpoint German and Russian tank designers realized that relatively narrow track would just sink in mud miring and thus disabling the tank As WWII veteran Belton Cooper described in Death Traps  American tank designers didn t get that memo To build historically accurate American tanks LEGO military modelers need something other than the official LEGO options The twowide Track Links tracks work beautifully on American medium tanks like the M3 LeeGrant M4 Sherman and all the tracked vehicles based on their chassis such as the M7 Priest and most WWII tank destroyers Dan himself has been replacing the existing track on many of his vehicles with Track Links including this beautifully camouflagepatterned M3 Grant and M10 tank de stroyer Just like regular LEGO track Track Links clip together with small pins on each side and they work well with a variety of LEGO gears Both the singlewide and doublewide Track Links wrap around the gears better than LEGO tracks or chain links and they roll just as well Here s my M3A1 Stuart light tank sporting the singlewide Track Links On a related note you ll notice that many military builders have begun using the new BrickArms M2HB 50 caliber machine gun I still like my own brickbuilt 50 cal but it s also nice to have an absolutely accurate option that s consistent with the BrickArms 30 caliber M1919 Browning machine gun In addition to Track Links and a 50 cal my M8 Scott 105mm Howitzer Motor Carriage with a gun that elevatesdepresses and an ammunition trailer includes several other custom elements Brickmania armored division minifig BrickArms shells Citizen Brick diamond plate tiles Will Chapman gave away several prototype M2HBs at BrickCon and now the production version is available from resellers like Brickmania and GI Brick  One difference between the initial prototype and the final production version is that the ammunition canister is a bit looser It won t fall out but it does have a tendency to flop around a bit Based on the high quality we ve come to expect from BrickArms over the years I m confident that a bit of retooling will address this minor issue soon Brickmania Track Links are available in three colors  black steel and reddish brown great for mudrust  on Brickmaniacom  along with the new BrickArms M2HB I ll also be posting reviews of several Brickmania kits that include Track Links over the next week or two so check back here for more Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest

funding goal and the first models that use these tracks are now appearing online These fine examples an M4 Sherman and two different versions of the Stuart light tank were built by LegoUli  These already were some of the best examples of minifigscale US WW2 tanks out there and built in old dark grey to boot This is a difficult colour to use because all kinds of handy parts builders have become used to such as cheese slopes  were never made in this particular shade It is probably the closest match to the colour of the real vehicles though The old track shoes were a bit narrow but thanks to the new track links this has now been rectified Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Ralph February 1 2014 LEGO  Models Brickmania

Brickmania Brickmania M113 Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle Review Wrapping up our current batch of Brickmania custom LEGO kits  today I ll be reviewing the M113 Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle  There wasn t anything I wanted to compare and contrast nor do I want to reveal any secrets by posting a breakdown photo so I m using Dan Siskind s own photos which are excellent and accurate The M113 armored personnel carrier has been in service for more than 50 years serving through the Vietnam War and Gulf War before being phased out in frontline US service by the Bradley  Alongside the Huey the M113 is one of the more iconic vehicles of the Vietnam era To be honest I m more than a little conflicted about the rise of Vietnamera LEGO models in recent years I m probably betterinformed about the Vietnam War than I am even about World War II  I ve read Stanley Karnow s Vietnam A History  Neil Sheehan s A Bright Shining Lie  Philip Caputo s A Rumor of War  and more Sure I ve watched all the usual movies about the war and its aftermath but it s been documentaries like National Geographic s Inside the Vietnam War that have brought home the true horror and complexity of a war that still feels unresolved Nevertheless Dan Siskind was kind enough to send along a copy of his M113 ACAV together with the World War II kits I reviewed previously suggesting that it might be interesting to review something more modern I agree and I can certainly appreciate an excellent LEGO model even if  maybe especially if  the subject matter isn t one I d normally choose to recreate in LEGO myself Like all of the Brickmania kits I ve reviewed so far the M113 is full of functionality All the hatches open and the rear door even has a smaller hatch built into it that opens separately Inside there s room enough to seat 10 minifigs Brickmania sells two versions of the M113  a basic M113 APC and a limited edition  ACAV armored cavalry version that I m reviewing today To my taste the basic APC kit reminds me a bit of a plain square box  which to be fair accurately reflects the source material So I was glad Dan sent the ACAV version By the way the plain  M113 APC is discounted on Brickmaniacom as of May 14 by 15 down to 130 In addition to the base APC the ACAV version of Dan s kit has additional features and accessories including a pair of BrickArms M60 machine guns Browning M2 50caliber machine gun lots of brickbuilt armor for the guns and four unique minifigs The ACAV version costs 25500 or 110 more than the nonsale price of the plain  version As a point of comparison custom minifigs alone usually cost about 20 each and the moreexpensive kit includes four of them The minifigs are notable for a couple of reasons First they re all wearing custom flak jackets created by MMCB Capes  and two of the figs sport BrickArms M1 pot helmets customprinted in camouflage by Citizen Brick  Second one of the minifigs is AfricanAmerican The actual kit doesn t come with these two BrickArms guns but this photo of the prototype Brickmania M113 is good for illustration purposes Thanks to racist recruiting practices even by the time segregation of the United States military ended shortly after World War II AfricanAmericans were severely underrepresented in the armed forces But by the Vietnam War AfricanAmericans  who made up 11 of the US population at the time  constituted nearly 13 of those who served during the war racism having taken a different turn in the intervening 20 years It often baffles me that LEGO military builders fail to reflect the true diversity of American service personnel so Dan s choice to include an AfricanAmerican soldier in his M113 kit is notable for its inclusivity Setting aside geopolitics and socioeconomics and getting back to the build though Dan s design includes some subtle or surprising techniques for such a boxy shape at the end Like the M2A4 Light Tank I reviewed a couple weeks ago the suspension incorporates halfstudoffset techniques to get the road wheels  spacing right There are even a couple of brickstressing combinations that you wouldn t see in an official LEGO set For example a section built from angled plates on the APC s front pressed the first row of sloped bricks up until I built the final row of slopes on top But in the end the model is very sturdy and playable It s obvious that Dan designed the Brickmania M113 with playability in mind The top of the APC pops off cleanly for straightforward access to the interior One very minor complaint is that I had to pull a couple of random bricks from my own collection in order to elevate the driver minifig up through the front hatch You can see the driver s station on the floor of the APC in the photo on the right behind the levers If you had no LEGO bricks at all yourself before getting this custom kit you might be frustrated by the inability to make the driver appear as he does on the box but for anybody with a spare 2 3 brick this is no big deal Still I thought it was a little odd that the separate packet of ACAV extras didn t include a brick or two to build a seat for the driver who isn t included in the plain  APC version Overall this was another Brickmania kit that provides an excellent balance of scale detail functionality and sturdiness Even though the source material isn t from a historical era in which I ll be doing much building myself anytime soon I can heartily recommend the custom kit itself And besides every minifig militia needs an APC or two in its motor pool for the next inevitable zombie apocalypse Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Andrew May 14 2013 LEGO  Models Brickmania  Military  Review  Vietnam Post navigation

wing Brought to life in LEGO by Patrick MAGO this monster of a model is built at a scale of roughly 110 It has a wingspan of 1 meter and weighs in at a hefty 6 kg 13 pounds It took Patrick approximately 10 months to build the model and he had to redesign it no less than 3 times during the process to deal with the weight Beyond the structure itself a big challenge in such a build is the

probably not the first thing to come to mind when contemplating the excitement of naval aviation who remembers seeing a helicopter in Top Gun  But these whirlybirds are the unsung heros of navies across the globe The UH2 Seasprite is a perfect example painstakingly detailed here in LEGO form by TBB s own Ralph Savelsberg  The Seasprite entered service with the United States Navy in the early 1960s and played a vital role rescuing downed pilots during the Vietnam War This particular model Ralph explains is an early model UH2A which served aboard the USS Forrestal in 1965 After a complete rebuild this helicopter was delivered 50 years later to the Royal New Zealand Navy Ralph is no stranger to building military aircraft particularly naval models  check out how he does it and his recent LEGO Sikorsky HH60G Pave Hawk  His newest creation is no less accurate or wellbuilt than his others Every angle and shape of the Seasprite has been captured The coloration and markings also help bring this beauty to life In fact it s so realistic it looks late for an important mission After all naval planes may get the glory but its naval helicopters which get the work orders Like this post Tell

Sikorsky HH  60G Pave Hawk is a twinturboshaft engine helicopter in service with the United States Air Force and TBB s own Ralph Savelsberg has chosen to depict this versatile helicopter in European

I instantly recognised the Hawk family resemblance There are a few details that I particular like for example Ralph s clever solutions to using a limited palate of dark bluish grey dark green and

has designed firstly for the knees using a 1 1 plate with clip as the pivot point and then the shoulderelbow joints which ingeniously use a droid torso For Star Wars fans the tan helmets would quickly be recognised as belonging to the Star Wars resistance trooper minifigures from Episode 7These are great helmets and work perfectly with the colouring and style of Simon s drones Like this post Tell

using the track as an assembly line for the Britishmade Churchill tanks  Women are the primary workers However you can see that there is an older man who has just turned up after work to help with turret placement I had to try and forgive Martin for having a yellow faced minifigure with flesh hands in the scene perhaps it is just me that finds that distressing to look at The overall scene is beautifully tied together as a cohesive whole I particularly love the old railway station backdrop with its large light fixtures and combination of glass dark red brick and stone grey pillars Like

2017 we look upon a world scarred by tension and despair where reason is too often discarded for demagoguery and life made meaningless by barrel bombs drone strikes and rampaging lorries Intolerance seems to spread among both people and nations the threat of violence never far off lurks ever closer These factors are not new to our species The equation has repeated itself often in human history far too frequently with horrifying consequences But our viciousness is not preordained By reminding us of our past misdeeds history can guide us to a better future If we forget history we will be doomed to repeat its mistakes Pascal pledges not to forget history s victims with this microscale version of Auschwitz Figures vary but as many as one million people were killed in Auschwitz before Soviet troops liberated the death camp in January 1945 Nazi Germany s largest such facility Auschwitz was the epicenter of what was perhaps mankind s most barbaric moments One could certainly praise the builder for this accurate and detailed recreation of Auschwitz  infamous gates But what is most striking is the message Pascal adds to it hopefully lost on no one that our darkest days may return

P51 Mustang roars to victory Historical builder Milan CMadge recently shared his version of one of the most iconic and influential fighter planes of World War II the P51D Mustang The P51D was not just a spectacular fighter outclassing most of its counterparts in combat but a real eyecatcher too The sleek and seductive lines that made the Mustang such a pretty plane are captured nicely here in LEGO form The color patterns are accurate and look really good The stickers are conservatively applied and add a nice bit of character to the model Overall the builder has done a fine job paying tribute to

German offensive on the Western Front during WW2 and an important turning point Lasting from 2126 december 1944 the battle took many lives as did the frigid cold This collaborative display depicting the battle directed by Ekjohnson1  won multiple awards at Brickfair Virginia There is so much to see in the diorama but some of the highlights include the excellent battle damage on the houses the church and the forested area just outside the town Collaborations can be very hard to do with builders of different styles and skills but the team managed to create a seamlessly flowing whole a respectable feat indeed The attention to detail on some of the buildings is impressive Check out the frontage on this townhouse  Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google

Contact Us Search Get tactical with a LEGO Black Ops II M8A1 Recently my favorite entry in the Call of Duty franchise  Black Ops II  was added to Xbox One backwards compatibility I picked up Treyarch Studios s 2012 vision of combat in 2025 again and felt inspired to build my favorite rifle in the game the M8A1 a rifle based on the real H K XM8  In addition to being inspired by the design of the gun itself I was motivated to build by the color scheme Most of the rifle in game is tan but its carry handle has a subtle bronze color I showed this color difference with two LEGO colors tan and medium dark flesh The latter color is fairly limited in parts selection which made its implementation a fun challenge Working features on the LEGO M8A1 include a moving trigger removable curved magazine and a sliding ambidextrous charging handle The tactical rail on the carry handle can attach a LEGO reflex sight that projects a red aiming dot onto a window piece I show and discuss these functions as well as a few techniques used to achieve the detail on the weapon in this four minute vi deo See more photos of the M8A1 on my Flickr  or check out other LEGO Black Ops weapons we have

Aircraft  Town Like an angel hurtling through the heavens at mach 3 With itssleek fuselage and arrowhead profile the Seraphim reconnaissance jet by Corvin Stichert seems to resemble the stepping stone between the SR71 Blackbird and the SSV Normandy SR1 from Mass Effect  Although the builder had more of the former in mind when building surely it s ultrafast aircraft like this that will eventually eliminate the boundary between sky and space Corvin puts all the curved slopes and wedges to excellent use in shaping the body resulting in a craft that seems primed for radar deflection rather than merely a little pixelated as a consequence of the bricks My favorite touch on this model is the realistic working landing gear and ordnance bays on the underside Corvin has also created a full ground

who remembers seeing a helicopter in Top Gun  But these whirlybirds are the unsung heros of navies across the globe The UH2 Seasprite is a perfect example painstakingly detailed here in LEGO form by TBB s own Ralph Savelsberg  The Seasprite entered service with the United States Navy in the early 1960s and played a vital role rescuing downed pilots during the Vietnam War This particular model Ralph explains is an early model UH2A which served aboard the USS Forrestal in 1965 After a complete rebuild this helicopter was delivered 50 years later to the Royal New Zealand Navy Ralph is no stranger to building military aircraft particularly naval models  check out how he does it and his recent LEGO Sikorsky HH60G Pave Hawk  His newest creation is no less accurate or wellbuilt than his others Every angle and shape of the Seasprite has been captured The coloration and markings also help bring this beauty to life In fact it s so realistic it looks late for an important mission After

reason this model caught my eye I have flown in Blackhawks and seen them close up in my previous line of work and I instantly recognised the Hawk family resemblance There are a few details that I particular like for example Ralph s clever solutions to using a limited palate of dark bluish grey dark green and olive green means the hubs on the wheels are actually dark green minifigure heads See

Helicopter  Military  Vehicle LEGO Focke Wulf Ta 152 Butcher Bird  prepares for action Master aircraft builder Maelven has built some unique and historically accurate planes but perhaps none are as eyecatching as his newest build the Focke Wulf Ta 152 H1 Designed by famed aeronautical engineer Kurt Tank the Ta 152 was a last ditch effort by the Luftwaffe during the closing days of the Third Reich to combat the highaltitude bombers deployed by the Allies Although only a handful were built the Ta 152 proved itself as a capable interceptor and among the fastest pistondriven fighters of the war The long nose and superbly sleek design which characterized this butcher bird are created expertly here in LEGO form The builder chose to adorn this particular model with the redorange paint scheme used by Luftwaffe ace Fritz Aufhammer Legend says Aufhammer adorned his plane in such colors to notify triggerhappy Flak crews that this strange and unfamiliar aircraft was actually on their side The Ta 152 is seen here in the process of being maintained and refitted The exposed engine compart ment is a nice touch and along with the other details really helps to bring this build to life

fighter outclassing most of its counterparts in combat but a real eyecatcher too The sleek and seductive lines that made the Mustang such a pretty plane are captured nicely here in LEGO form The color

Have you ever watched a movie about a bad guy  but by the end of the movie despite the terrible things he has done you almost want him to get away That is exactly how I feel while looking at this World War 2 scene by J2J depicting the final stand of a German tanker as American troops close in The builder does an excellent job of telling a story with one small scene by coordinating small details throughout The fire smoke a dead German soldier in the background  all allow us to accurately infer the sequence of events that likely led to this moment making the scene quite dramatic and emotion evoking Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Peter September 10 2017 LEGO  Models Minifigure  Scene  World War II John F Kennedy s

fighterbomber produced by Hawker Aircraft during World War II Einon s LEGO version of the Typhoon features a fully retractable landing gear and carries eight rockets under the wings and two bombs The real life bomber had a few design issues but Einon has managed to iron out some of these in his minifigurescale version The brickbuilt propeller is a good solution for sizing on this model but the invasion stripes on the upper wing surfaces and fuselage seal this as an accurate wartime Typhoon Einon has made a short video that not only shares more details about the Typoon but also demonstrates

February 24 2017 LEGO  Models Aircraft  Military  World War II LEGO Focke Wulf Ta 152 Butcher Bird  prepares for action Master aircraft builder Maelven has built some unique and historically accurate planes but perhaps none are as eyecatching as his newest build the Focke Wulf Ta 152 H1 Designed by famed aeronautical engineer Kurt Tank the Ta 152 was a last ditch effort by the Luftwaffe during the closing days of the Third Reich to combat the highaltitude bombers deployed by the Allies Although only a handful were built the Ta 152 proved itself as a capable interceptor and among the fastest pistondriven fighters of the war The long nose and superbly sleek design which characterized this butcher bird are created expertly here in LEGO form The builder chose to adorn this particular model with the redorange paint scheme used by Luftwaffe ace Fritz Aufhammer Legend says Aufhammer adorned his plane in such colors to notify triggerhappy Flak crews that this strange and unfamiliar aircraft was actually on their side The Ta 152 is seen here in the process of being maintained and refitted The exposed engine compartment is a nice touch and along with the other details really helps to bring this build to life Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Patrick January 12 2017 LEGO  Models Aircraft  Military  World War II Motorized

scene We ve previously featured his Edinburgh s Royal Mile and desert market creations but this WWIIinspired diorama is his best yet It s a recreation of the moments when Allied forces liberated the Dutch town of Venlo on 1st March 1945 The damaged buildings are beautifully done giving a sense of what the townsfolk must have endured as the battle raged around them Maarten has included numerous small vignettes throughout his diorama such as the American GIs interacting with the survivors The details of the lefthand house are particularly poignant  the remnants of the upperfloor telling a tale of shattered domesticity And whilst I m not a dog person  myself even I can appreciate the message of hope for the future as one of the townspeople finds his pet amidst the ruins Like this post

s been a couple of years since I ve reviewed the custom LEGO kits designed by Dan Siskind of Brickmania  Back in 2013 I reviewed the Dodge WC54 Ambulance  and writing those reviews really got me started in building World War II models seriously In the meantime Dan and his team have continued to release new custom kits on a nearweekly cadence One of Dan s recent Brickmania releases is the M3A1 Scout Car  produced by the White Motor Company between 1940 and 1944 The vehicle served throughout WW2 and its basic design served as the basis of the iconic M3 Halftrack Like some of the custom kits

small  Barnstomer  plane rudelyflying low on a farmer s land Take a few seconds to look at this build There are no complex techniques nor an overwhelming amount of parts  it s just the right amount of bricks used in the right places What I also love about this build is the small scale of the plane It s absolutely minute and there was some cheating done with the build I assume the minifig head is just stuck on a brick or one of the 2X2 driver s bodies that have a minifig head peg  They were popular with the Drome Racers theme in the early 2000 s and it s a good way to simulate a full minifig

tempted to make everything smooth and sleek No danger of that here with Joshua Brooks  Manticore Truck offering a serious sense of heft and gritty purpose This comes in no small part from the impressive levels of texture and detailing evident despite the relatively restrained colour scheme I particularly like the winch on the front fender and the tools clipped on the sides  details which

be colored variations of realistic  gray nor must they be actual ships in space Master of motorized LEGO builds mahjqa has built a jarringly beautiful planetary exploitation crawler or landship  named Khagaan  which has two smaller fully motorized rovers to gather resources and space junk The main vehicle is 43 inches long 109 cm weighs 20 pounds 9 kg and the builder says he used 25000 LEGO pieces to create it It s not often that we re fooled into thinking that a LEGO video is a render rather than the real thing  it s more frequently the other way around  but watch through to the end of mahjqa s video to see behindthescenes footage proving that all but the background and dust are practical effects the reallive feline interloper proves it See more photos of this amazing trio of LEGO vehicles

Generation Instructions We re probably gonna see more Trek builds than usual this year it being the 30th anniversary of Star Trek The Next Generation  Such as this minifig scale Type 6 shuttle designed by Jerry builds LEGO  which captures the lines of this iconic vessel perfectly thanks to deft use of some canopies probably from a Star Wars set I m not even gonna check I assume it s a Star Wars set since there s not exactly a shortage of those to choose from As an added treat Mr Builds With LEGO has even put together this neat instructional video showing you how to build one of these for yourself I like the format of this video in which each step is shown being built so you can easily follow along The video doesn t show which sets you ll have to rip apart to get those lovely canopies or how far you ll have to search to find matching STNG minifigs  that s an exercise left for the viewer Of course in the Star Trek universe transporters are method of choice for getting from point A to point B But if you think really hard about it they re actually just giant death machines and the entire franchise is just the story of hoards of people and their subsequent clones willingly stepping into oblivion So it s no wonder there a few characters in the show actually opt to travel exclusively by shuttle craft Slower and more tedious but at least it gets to you your destination

build is the show s SHADO Moonbase Interceptor  the primary defence spacecraft of a highly secretive agency called Supreme Headquarters Alien Defence Organisation or SHADO for short Andrea has really captured the hull shaping and red stripe details of the Interceptors with their comical nosemounted nuclear missiles The Interceptor is instantly recognisable to those of a certain age  Not content with just having the outward shaping the cockpit and roof can be removed to show some interior details including control sticks a comfy red pilot seat and some powerfullooking engine areas My only

actually move When you add a cyborg handler the build just gets better By putting a KELOIDesque cyborg head on a Scala doll body the resulting character perfectly matches the style of Botdog and

franchise  Black Ops II  was added to Xbox One backwards compatibility I picked up Treyarch Studios s 2012 vision of combat in 2025 again and felt inspired to build my favorite rifle in the game the M8A1 a rifle based on the real H K XM8  In addition to being inspired by the design of the gun itself I was motivated to build by the color scheme Most of the rifle in game is tan but its carry handle has a subtle bronze color I showed this color difference with two LEGO colors tan and medium dark flesh The latter color is fairly limited in parts selection which made its implementation a fun challenge Working features on the LEGO M8A1 include a moving trigger removable curved magazine and a sliding ambidextrous charging handle The tactical rail on the carry handle can attach a LEGO reflex sight that projects a red aiming dot onto a window piece I show and discuss these functions as well as a few techniques used to achieve the detail on the weapon in this four minute vi deo See more

Step inside a typical Malaysian heritage house Heritage houses arewonderful older styled buildings with a typical faade that can be found dotted around many locations in Malaysia Vincent Kiew has created a beautiful LEGO heritage house complete with detailed interior I love the faade with its wooden louvre shutters and architectural decorations above the arched windowsThe use of a mix of white and older yellowed white bricks really adds to the antiquated  appearance The same slightly worn down appearance is provided by the mix of colours in the main left hand side of the house with light grey white and the odd sand green brick as an aesthetic colour scheme Vincent has created a detailed interior for the house complete with kitchen living room bedroom study toilet and more The build is

war machine was an impressive force in its time and to this day inspires many people for better or for worse This time it is for the better as the Russian LEGO building duo Dmitriy and Anna have created an extremely expressive legionnaire using a relatively limited selection of bricks There are many simple solutions for complex shapes like exposed studs as the kneecaps and chin as well as curved slopes that capture the shape of lorica segmentata perfectly The warrior s weapons should not go unnoticed either while the gladius in its scabbard is not quite perfect I do not see how it

by Ryan is a real blast from the past considering how far technology has come since those early and wild days of personal computers This particular model is the Macintosh 128k  originally released as the Apple Macintosh  the company s original personal computer With some 4500 bricks in its construction this LEGO recreation must be as hefty as the real thing But don t let the computer steal the show however The 80s vibe is enhanced by the addition of a rolodex and clunky calculator which alongside the 128k won t be found on any work station in the 21st Century  today s bargainlevel smartphone can do all this and so much more For younger readers who don t remember such things the slot on the front of the computer accepts 35inch floppy disks which according to the US Government Accountability Office are still used to coordinate the operational functions of the nation s nuclear forces Doesn t that make you feel comfortable The Apple logo and the friendly icon on the warmingup screen are great touches as well Overall a very accurate and rather nostalgic take on the 80s workdesk The only thing missing is a can of Tab and the sweet soothing sounds of Duran Duran Like this

As we enter 2017 we look upon a world scarred by tension and despair where reason is too often discarded for demagoguery and life made meaningless by barrel bombs drone strikes and rampaging lorries Intolerance seems to spread among both people and nations the threat of violence never far off lurks ever closer These factors are not new to our species The equation has repeated itself often in human history far too frequently with horrifying consequences But our viciousness is not preordained By reminding us of our past misdeeds history can guide us to a better future If we forget history we will be doomed to repeat its mistakes Pascal pledges not to forget history s victims with this microscale version of Auschwitz Figures vary but as many as one million people were killed in Auschwitz before Soviet troops liberated the death camp in January 1945 Nazi Germany s largest such facility Auschwitz was the epicenter of what was perhaps mankind s most barbaric moments One could certainly praise the builder for this accurate and detailed recreation of Auschwitz  infamous gates But what is most striking is the message Pascal adds to it hopefully lost on no one that our darkest

Black Ops II  was added to Xbox One backwards compatibility I picked up Treyarch Studios s 2012 vision of combat in 2025 again and felt inspired to build my favorite rifle in the game the M8A1 a rifle based on the real H K XM8  In addition to being inspired by the design of the gun itself I was motivated to build by the color scheme Most of the rifle in game is tan but its carry handle has a subtle bronze color I showed this color difference with two LEGO colors tan and medium dark flesh The latter color is fairly limited in parts selection which made its implementation a fun challenge Working features on the LEGO M8A1 include a moving trigger removable curved magazine and a sliding ambidextrous charging handle The tactical rail on the carry handle can attach a LEGO reflex sight that projects a red aiming dot onto a window piece I show and discuss these functions as well as a few techniques used to achieve the detail on the weapon in this four minute vi deo See more photos of the M8A1 on my Flickr  or check out other LEGO Black Ops weapons we have featured such as the PDW57 SMG and KRM262 shotgun  Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit

 Deals  Friends  Super Heroes Doc Ock Truck Heist 76015 Review Doc Ock Truck Heist is one of the Lego Super Heroes sets released in March 2014 It retails for 1999 and is available on Amazon  Below is a brief video review and my remarks regarding the set Pros The exploding safes is an interesting play feature The design for the armored truck is decent and includes a unique green train window Cons Besides Doc Ock the other minifigures are not unique to the set Spider Man s web catapult does not work This set has the potential for higher marks from me but the lack of more than one unique minifig and the default suboptimal design of the play features are setbacks In order for the exploding safes to eject from the truck you ll have to switch to frictionless technic pins as I ve shown in the video There is unfortunately no fix for the web catapult so it should just be regarded as decoration Otherwise I like the design of the truck despite an overall average selection of parts Judging from trends on other older Super Heroes sets I expect Amazon will have discount the set by about 25 after several months when fall is here Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest

2014 It retails for 1999 and is available on Amazon  Below is a brief video review and my remarks regarding the set Pros Very sturdy vehicle with suspension on the wheels Includes 3 unique minifigures with new printing for Captain America A modest selection of olive green parts Cons Low price per part ratio Very simple build no noteworthy techniques to highlight This is a decent 20 Lego Super Heroes set The battle vehicle is great for play but among adult builders and collectors there s little value to it other than the olive green parts and the minifigs This is one of the easier sets I ve built and takes very little time Judging from trends on other older Super Heroes sets I expect Amazon will have discount the set by about 25 after several months when fall is here Like this post Tell

Contact Us Search Enter Elvendale the village of colours and magic Stepping out of her favourite theme of modular buildings Vesna Todorovi has struck gold with this Elvesthemed diorama Heavily inspired by the Elves Netflix series and a bit of the official sets too the builder had the idea in her head for quite a while before amassing enough bright colours to realize it She notes that the diorama was a great opportunity to use not only new colours but new bricks too including many floral elements Angry Bird s eggs and all sorts of Elves and Friends decorative elements The cliff in the back is recycled from an earlier diorama  with appropriate upgrades of course The foliage is bright and colourful as are the cute little cottages  exactly in the official theme s style There are interiors built for all the cottages but sadly the buildings don t come apart to bephotographed This diorama was one of my favourite builds at the 19th Kockefest  the Slovenian LUG s display and many people I talked to there from fans to casual visitors agreed Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Related Luka November 8 2017 LEGO

minidolls and the retired LEGO ExoForce theme and perhaps eating a little too much cheese before bed What if ExoForce continued to evolve and then got assimilated by Friends  These six ExoFriends were the result The minidolls look very cute with their new hair styles even if some of their exosuits are rather more intimidating We have an eyecatching lime exosuit looselybased on the alternate build

really shows this fun build in its best light I love the blue and white colour blocking with the little highlights of red adding a nice contrast Just to prove this is an exosuit with a pilot you can

Contact Us Search When LEGO themes collide ExoForce  Friends  ExoFriends Tyler Sky has been thinking about Friends minidolls and the retired LEGO ExoForce theme and perhaps eating a little too much cheese before bed What if ExoForce continued to evolve and then got assimilated by Friends  These six ExoFriends were the result The minidolls look very cute with their new hair styles even if some of their exosuits are rather more intimidating We have an eyecatching lime exosuit looselybased on the alternate build suggestion for 7712 Supernova  Those clawed toes look very flexible and give the impression this ExoFriends character is not limited by gravity and can climb any obstacle My own favourite comes next with a balanced mix of Bionicle and System elements all rolled into one The blues compliment the Pearl Grey very nicely making for the most classical mechalooking of all the ExoFriends This yellow ExoFriend was inspired by amazontextlink asin B000NO9FHC  text LEGO 8106 Aero Booster  template ProductLink  store tbbwpplugin20  marketplace US  linkid b47fbdebf83e11e694019ff3660e2b43  The rollerfeet deserve a special mention This looks like a speedy mecha with a handy snowboard attached  just in case The tallest of the ExoFriends comes next and represents Tyler s impression of the next level of evolution in the theme However I can t help but think this minidoll is wearing her father s suit Good positioning of a tiny kitty for scale Meow I know you are busy being an ExoFriend and everything but I only have half a bowl of nibbles left This purple and lilac tracked ExoFriend is more of a vehicle than a suit and is looselybased on amazontextlink asin B000Y8GSDG  text LEGO 8118 Hybrid Rescue Tank  template ProductLink  store tbbwpplugin20  marketplace US  linkid faaf3aa2f83d11e6977c37d07752f0dd  I love the bunny providing topcover on the roof mounted weapons system Finally on the far right is Tyler s spiky azure suit This suit is not based on any particular set but was an attempt to capture in an out of this world vehicle  that would fit into a Japanese anim cartoon If there was a points system for hairstyle matching your exosuit then this one would definitely win So there we have it six ExoFriends to start off a new theme Which one is your favourite If you like this mix of Friends and mecha you should check out these Mecha Friends that are ready

Contact Us Search LEGO Creator 10253 Big Ben Review The clock tower of the British Houses of Parliament is an English icon known the world over Oddly enough the famously named Big Ben is actually the largest of the 5 bells housed within the towerwith the clock tower beingproperly called the Elizabeth Tower However over the last 157 years since the tower s completion it s becomeglobally known as Big Ben And now it has inspiredLEGO s second largest architecture set ever 10253 Big Ben  with 4163 pieces  The setis currentlyavailable to LEGO VIP members and will go on sale to everyone beginning July 1 for 24999 10253 Big Ben is a massive set just by parts count alone not to mention that the finished model stands nearly two feet tall Inside the box you ll find loads of bags numbered for subassemblies 1 through 7 a bag of miscellaneous large pieces and the bagged instructions For no discernable reason the bags for subassembly 2come in a plain white box The base is made of large plates not a smoothbottomed baseplate which allows for a bit of the Thames at the east end of the palace to be represented in blue The build process is relatively straightforward working studsup in rows around the entire foundation with just a few exceptions for studsnotontop facade details Right away in the first level of bricks you ll encounter one of the more unique bits of construction in the set bricks set at 45 angles from the normal plate axes to mimicthe stone columns on the detailed exterior walls With over 4000 pieces 10253 Big Ben is a highly detailed set Most of the pieces are some version of 1 1 and 1 2 plates and bricks and many of them come in multiples of hundreds So it s no surprise that the build can be a bit tedious occasionally feeling as if you re not making much progress when you ve just placed several hundred pieces on the model and realize that you ve only made the building a single brick taller However there are some highlights such as a very clever little technique to place a 1 1 with 5 studs on one of the building s corners while maintaining a dark tan line of detail around the building s foundation The designer s solution is to place 1 1 corner panels upside down around the unwanted studs an elegant solution Note the common fan solution of placing 1 1 Technic bricks adjacent to the 1 1 with 5 studs is actually verboten in official sets since Technic pin holes are at just slightly a different height than sideways studs thereby stressing the bricks when forced together Additionally this still would not leave the dark tan row of plates around the base The final model has just beautiful detail On the building front the 1 1 bricks twisted 45 create a visually interesting front which are held secure by tan 3 3 cross plates On the east end of the building the large windows areset a halfstud out from the rest of the wall which also gives a nice visual appeal The section is held secure using a combination of clipsbars and jumper tiles The lone tree out front is a brilliantly simple microscale tree taking advantage of the new 6stemmed flower stalk and no doubt we ll see this technique proliferate in the fan community The clock tower is perhaps the most repetitive portion of the build with five nearly identical floors each consisting of hundreds of pieces in a pattern The walls of the tower are made of sideways plates stuck to a central support column by way of bracket plates The second floor houses a simple gear mechanism which connects the small clock on the south side behind the tow er to the large clock faces in the spire Turning the small clock makes the hands on the clock tower move The mainclock floor houses a large gear and on the back of each clock face is a smaller gear which meshes when the clock face is in place so the hands on all four clocks move in sync Sadly the hands are in fixed positions relative to each other so it can t really be set to a specific time via this mechanism Just above the clock is Big Ben itself hidden in the completedmodel It s in the picture above just above the clock behind the tan telescope piece Fortunately the model does come apart with the grey roof sitting on tiles to facilitate easy removal for access to the bell Finally this set comes with a lot of extra pieces Free pieces are always a nice bonus and in this set you ll really hit the motherload Many of the extra pieces are tools from the clocks  hands Since minifig tools come in a prepack of 9 unique tools and only the socket wrench and closed wrenchare used on each clock face you ll end up with 4 extras of each of the other 7 tools  Overall I enjoy the set and recommend it It istrue that it s arepetitive build process making itconsiderably less enjoyable to build than some of the other big sets we ve reviewed like 75827 Ghostbusters Firehouse Headquarters  76052 Batman Classic TV Series Batcave  or 42056 Porsche 911 GT3 RS  But the finishedmodel s exquisite detail and stately demeanor make it

of sets that includes 10247 Ferris Wheel  10244 Fairground Mixer  and of course 10196 Grand Carousel from 2009 The new Carousel has five brickbuilt animals galloping around its platform which spins with a hand crank and comes ready for Power Functions integration The set includes seven minifigures and will retail for 19999 USD It will be available June 1 2017 The original carousel from 8 years ago is greatly loved but the fact that LEGO is circling back to the same carnival ride after only two intervening sets is sure to raise some eyebrows However the old 10196 Carousel is so highly desired by fans that it s currently selling for around 1700 for an unopened copy and over 1100 for a used version a rare figure outside the Star Wars and Modular themes Certainly many fans who can t afford to spend over 1k on a single set will be glad to see this version Although slightly smaller than the original the new set carries a 50 lower MSRP likely due to the Power Functions being an optional extra this time Although we spy plenty of elements in new colors however we haven t spotted any completely new elements apart from the cloth roof panels Let us know in the comments if you see

TBB FAQ Archives 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 Categories LEGO Models News Building Techniques People Resources Instructions Reviews LEGO Glossary History of LEGO Contact Us Search LEGO Disney 71040 Cinderella Castle Review As something of a Disney geek I was delighted to get the opportunity to review the new LEGO Disney Cinderella Castle set However I have to admit I was somewhat taken aback when the box arrived and I began to realise what an undertaking the build process was going to be  The enormous box contains a huge amount of LEGO pieces  no fewer than 27 numbered bags  plus a hefty 490page instruction manual When you tip it all out on the floor you begin to understand why this set is as pricey as it is and how big it s going to end up Whilst this is unambiguously communicated as a complex 16 set I d imagine it will be purchased by many adult Disney fans who may not have built with LEGO for some time They re going to be surprised at the complexity and ingenuity of some of the techniques used Further the subject matter will no doubt encourage a bunch of parents to buy this for their kids to play with Whilst it s a brilliant set and the build is fun it does take a VERY long time I pity the poor dads who start building this for their impatient princes and princesses on Christmas morning  with luck they may be finished sometime on Boxing Day The instruction manual is a big beast It has two pages outlining the history and attributes of the real Cinderella Castle in Walt Disney World s Magic Kingdom These are followed by a doublepage spread which highlights some of the set s Easter Egg  features  scenes or props taken from a range of classic Disney movies The rest of this weighty tome is dedicated to the 758 steps it ll take to complete the construction process I couldn t resist comparing the outline of the model with some Disneyworld technical information and concept artwork This comparison gives an idea of how close to the genuine article the set turns out  pretty close although the model s open back means you miss a couple of the taller towers which sprout from the rear of the real castle s central keep The Build Process As you d expect it all begins with the base  a sturdy Technic frame reinforced with larger plates There s good color differentiation between the bricks used so even less experienced builders won t get lost or make an early mistake After a solid hour of work the base is complete Although this wouldn t appear the most exciting phase of construction I was never bored and particularly enjoyed putting the mosaic floor together Rotated by 45 degrees it s an interesting section and the technique might come as a surprise to people who haven t bought a LEGO set for a while Similarly there are some basic SNOT StudsNotOnTop techniques introduced during the next phase Again perhaps nothing new to the experienced adult LEGO fan but likely a revelation to less experienced builders There are some offthegrid  curves created as you put together the castle s ground floor The combination of hinged pillars and arches is smartly done and combines with some clever brickwork around the front to make for an interesting building experience By this point you re about two hours into construction and things are beginning to come together nicely  Before you get started on the external walls you get to build a couple of cool details  the grandfather clock and the brilliant little lanterns by the front gates The process of putting together the big exterior wall is relatively simple although the angled connection attaching the towers to the central gatehouse is clever and worth tucking away in the techniques box for personal use When I first saw the reveal  photos of this set I wasn t convinced by the use of the large wedges to create the flared effect on the round towers However inthebrick these look really good and I think they were a good solution for the complex tapering cylinder shape The technique used for the windows at the top of the round towers is interesting with a bunch of angled building and it requires paying careful attention to the instructions However this is one of those phases where you end up building the same thing over and over  your admiration for the clever technique may pall by the third time you re putting it together By now you ve been building for around four hours That s a lengthy period but there s a genuine sense of achievement as you complete the lower section of the model It all looks great particularly the detailed gatehouse and the clock nestling in the eaves of the roof  You spend the next couple of hours building the castle s central keep It has less offthegrid elements than the lower section and as a result the structural elements are generally less interesting to build than those in the previous phase However the more everyday building process is compensated for with the fun to be had in putting together the detailed interior The castle contains various different rooms each with elements taken from classic Disney movies The kitchen apparently inspired by The Little Mermaid  looks great and has some nice touches but is perhaps the weakest of the moviethemed Easter Eggs  It doesn t contain much to link it to the film It might have been good to have included a little red crab evoking the scene where Sebastian escapes the chef The Beauty and the Beast hallway is perhaps my favourite of the interior spaces despite it being relatively simple in layout The rose in the jar is nicely done and Lumiere the dancing candlestick is a wonderful little model Other rooms include a bedroom an attic a tower room featuring the Magic Mirror and a smaller area with a spinning wheel Overall the interior is visually interesting and fun to put together The rooms provide some good play features once the set is complete  a nice touch for younger kids who couldn t be involved in the complex build itself The angled balcony provides the most noteworthy building technique in this section There s a smart mix of Technic regular bricks and brackets used to create the octagon shape  So after six hours you ve completed the central keep including the ornate window and the distinctive Mansardstyle roof  The final element is the addition of the tall central tower This is split into two construction stages and features some intricate detailing and one piece of very clever upsidedown building for the base of the sidemounted tower near the pinnacle The golden spire at the tower s tip involves sideways building using pearl gold 1 1 round plates and dark tan bricks  not the most obvious of color combinations yet it works out nicely and the shape is a good approximation of the original Allinall the build is great fun and features smart and complex techniques  some of which I was surprised to see in an official set I m pretty sure a couple of things in here are on the borderline of what LEGO would consider as legal  connections The construction process also features moments you only get in the best LEGO sets  when something looks odd and you can t work out why it s built like that and then at a later stage all becomes clear and the peculiar arrangement becomes a key support or enabler of a brilliant feature Having said that although it s an enjoyable experience don t underestimate how long the build will take I had to split it over several days due to real world  work and needing decent light for photos however in total it still took me around seven hours to complete the model The Final Model Make no mistake the completed castle is beautiful And enormous It stands 75cm high and 47cm wide You ll want to display it no doubt about it  but are you sure you ve got a space big enough There are minor things which irk me about the final model The interior has a couple of ugly behind the scenes  elements on display  Technic bricks and pins which could easily have been covered up And there s a panel featuring three shields which wobble and spin when they could have been mounted in a fixed position However that s nitpicking at an otherwise beautifullydesigned set Some Disney fans have questioned the color choices for the central keep and it s true the Floridian original is an offwhite shade rather than the tan and white version we get here However an allwhite build would have seen the ornate detail disappearing into the background  a shame considering the effort which has gone into designing it and you will put into building it Tan seems like a good solution and ensures the attention to detail in this striking model can be seen properly even at a distance The Minifigs The set includes five minifigs Mickey Minnie Donald Daisy and Tinkerbell I think they re great additions to the set but your mileage will vary according to your attitude to these characters I m sure there will be people who would rather have seen a range of Disney Princesses or perhaps classic movie characters linked to the Easter Egg  scenes but I m very happy with Mickey  Co The Parts Selection This set contains A LOT OF LEGO Seriously it s big enough to start a decent LEGO collection from scratch  just add a small Creator box of basic bricks and some wheels and you re well on your way to having all you need This is much more the case with this set than with other big sets in LEGO s range  if you ve ever bought a massive Star Wars set and thought that s a lot of gray plates  then you ll know what I mean As I was working my way through the construction process I spotted a few pieces I thought were new or notable  But my favorite piece in the entire set has to be this supercute book I m not going to suggest the set is worth buying just to get hold of this but it s a closerun thing  The Brothers Brick Verdict 71040 Cinderella s Castle is a wonderful LEGO set It isn t cheap but for the price you get an immense quantity of bricks for you or your kids to play with if you ever tire of having the castle on display The building process is long but thoroughly enjoyable and regardless of your level of experience you re going to learn some nice new tricks and building techniques Overall the resemblance to the Disney original is amazing and the set design represents an affectionate tribute to a muchloved icon of Walt Disney World If you like castles or Disney or just enjoy building a big set then you simply have to get yourself one of these  just don t underestimate how long it s going to take you to put it together LEGO Disney

Contact Us Search Hands on with the new LEGO Star Wars 75192 UCS Millennium Falcon Review When LEGO sends The Brothers Brick an early copy of a LEGO set to review receiving it a few days before it s widely available is generally not a problem We just spend a couple evenings building photographing and writing up the review  no big deal But when the new 75192 Ultimate Collector s Millennium Falcon lands with a resounding thump  on our doorstep two days before it s available to LEGO VIP Program members that s a bit of a different story TBB Senior Editor Chris Malloy and I have spent literally every spare moment since last Monday a week and a half ago slaving at the brick to bring you our handson review of the largest LEGO set ever released The new UCS Millennium Falcon includes 7541 pieces with 10 minifigs and costs USD 79999 That obviously makes it the mostexpensive LEGO set ever released and we ll address the price later in the review Fair warning up front that this review will be as much about the subjective build experience and our Gestalt perspective on the completed model as it will be about details like parts minifigs and building techniques We expect that many of our readers will not be able to afford an 800 set and we want to give you as much vicarious insight as possible into the endtoend expe rience We ll also do our best to compare this set with the earlier 10179 UCS Millennium Falcon from 2007 The box and instruction book The obligatory The box  section in our LEGO set reviews is generally intended for our readers who are interested in seeing what s on the back of the box before they buy it and of course to let everyone know whether it s a disposable box or reusable collector s box like LEGO Architecture and earlier LEGO Ideas sets I don t find cardboard packaging particularly scintillating myself  I m more about the little plastic bricks on the inside  and I only write those sections somewhat under duress after much goading and nagging from Chris on our readers  behalf But there are certainly LEGO sets whose packaging blows me away like the lovingly placed tires and small printed details in the 42056 Porsche 911 GT3 RS released last year The Falcon s box isn t quite so  artisanal  but she s got it where it counts kid The box clocks in at a whopping 288 pounds It s about 21 inches wide 18 inches tall and 15 inches deep 53 x 46 x 38 cm Inside there s a tray for the instructions which themselves clocks in at a monstrous 64 pounds 29 kg Underneath there are 4 interior boxes that contain the set s 17 sets of numbered bags The interior boxes line up with a printed scene showing line art of the Falcon along with lines from Han Solo about the Millennium Falcon  Mere words like whopping  and monstrous  don t really do justice until you ve seen this box yourself in person LEGO stores apparently provide special wheel attachments so customers don t do themselves an injury hauling it away Here s the box again with a 32 32 baseplate for scale The back and sides of the box include more line art and photos of the play features interior details and minifigs The instruction booklet is hardly a book let  It s a ringbound book that weighs more than 64 pounds 29 kg The book isn t just heavy it s big  165 inches wide by 114 inches tall 42 x 29 cm That results in a lower overall page count than one might expect though the earlier 10179 UCS Millennium Falcon s instructions was also ringbound The resulting tome is 466 pages long spanning 1379 steps Compare again to 10179 with 314 pages 10179 s mainline  instructions only counted final assembly of subcomponents so ended with step 97 on the final instructions page  I m not currently inclined to count the actual total sequential steps The first 16 pages of the instruction book include concept art by Ralph McQuarrie and other Star Wars artists schematics from the Essential Guide series of reference books and interviews with several of the designers who contributed to the LEGO set We interviewed the LEGO Star Wars designers ourselves recently so be sure to check out our report from the midnight launch event in London One of the designers talks about the bake test  that LEGO sets go through to stresstest connections by heating a set up in an oven or a public sauna in the case of this massive set  part of the design process that secretive LEGO has not previously revealed While some of the questions and answers aren t especially revealing the interviews are well worth a read  probably after you ve skipped over them first to start building right away The build First let s take some time to put this build into perspective Most LEGO Star Wars sets I build  both for fun and to review here on TBB  are in the 50150 range and I generally spend a pleasant evening building something like 75101 First Order Special Forces TIE Fighter 70 or 75187 BB8 120 Building quickly and granted that when I build for pleasure I m not building for speed I can bang out a 50 set with about 500 pieces in something between one and three hours  a pleasant weekday evening or Sunday afternoon diversion It s worth emphasizing again that 75192 Millennium Falcon includes 17 groups of bags averaging 444 pieces in each group So that s like building a typical 50 Star Wars set seventeen times  Aiming for speed to get this review out in a timely manner I averaged about an hour per bag group so building the Millennium Falcon took the equivalent of more than two 8hour work days occupying 100 of my available spare time over this past week in my defense as a participating member of my household I did clean the gutters and clear some blackberry vines If I were building this purely for leisure lingering to admire details and techniques it would likely have taken twice as long and I d probably have spread it out over a couple of weeks Other sites have done multiperson team builds that still took 12 hours over 2 days Part of the problem with the multibag packaging inside interior boxes is that the bags are not arranged sequentially in the boxes Presumably to balance the weight of the boxed set or some other arcane production reason bag groups are distributed seemingly randomly throughout the four boxes For example the first box we opened had the bags numbered 1 4 14 and 15 So yo u ll spend the first few minutes of your build experience digging through deep interior boxes looking for sorting and rearranging bags With that sheer scale and impact on your daytoday nonLEGO life in mind let s begin  The first six sets of bags all primarily build the Falcon s underlying Technic frame which 75192 largely shares with 10179 confirmed by LEGO set designer Hans Burkhard Schl mer in the Q A section The LEGO Falcon s core frame consists of Technic beams sandwiched between plates reinforced by 3L Technic liftarms and pins Very little recognizable detail is in the first group of bags but the first six of the Falcon s seven landing gear are built from the parts in the second group of bags Chewbacca and C3PO turn up in the third group of bags accompanied by a pair of little creatures from The Last Jedi called porgs We ll cover the minifigs and creatures in more detail later in this review The third bag adds the underside of the front mandible the forward landing gear assembly and two interior sections The main hold area includes the lounge where Threepio advises Artoo to Let the wookie win  while playing the chesslike holographic dejarik game The lounge area includes padded seating and the dejarik board is printed on a black radar dish The engineering station has a swiveling seat and a mix of printed and stickered elements The corridor entrances are particularly ingenious with tan elements that encircle the doorway To create the illusion of a curved corridor that extends to other parts of the cavernous ship LEGO Star Wars graphic designer Madison O Neil created stickers that you apply to 1x6x5 panels and slip in behind the round entrances The brickbuilt archway combined with the stickered panel create a trompe l oeil effect that would certainly fool Wile E Coyote or any nearsighted Imperial stormtrooper The sticker sheet itself is fairly large but the actual number of stickers is small for such a large set with the specification sheet and corridor entrances taking up most of the sticker sheet Bag group 3 includes the seat for the upper quad cannon emplacement which won t get completed until the very final bag group 17 The core Technic frame also supports two greeble sections that will remain exposed after all the hull sections are added Han Solo and Leia Organa turn up in the fourth set of bags wearing their coldweather Hoth gear from The Empire Strikes Back  with the parts for the rear port interior section and the first subassemblies for the outer hull According to both DK reference books that show the Falcon s interior layout  Star Wars Incredible CrossSections from 1998 and Star Wars The Force Awakens Incredible CrossSections from 2015 the rear compartment includes the crew quarters and access to the hyperdrive with escape pods near the centerline of the ship The rear interior compartment in 75192 Millennium Falcon compromises a little bit with absolute movie and reference book accuracy in favor of more interesting details than a bank of bunk beds so you get the Class 05 IsuSim SSP05 hype rdrive and engineering bay where they belong with a pair of doorways for escape pods on the far port side where the bunks should be There are also three arched doorways leading off into curved corridors with another pair of stickered panels The floor of the rear compartment has a 1 4 plate that is removable presumably to reenact smuggling activities not shown on screen in the Classic Trilogy or the scene in The Force Awakens when Rey Finn and BB8 try to hide from Han and Chewie However the space is so small that you can t fit one minifig underneath the 1 4 plate much less several Regardless it s a fun detail The subassemblies for the lower hull s exterior sections are not especially interesting largely built from plates attached to more Technic beams which then clip onto the core Technic frame with pins Other than a floor to provide an exterior hull the starboard interior section is empty  something I ll come back to when discussing the finished model The fifth group of bags finishes the rear underside of the hull along with the iconic sublight engines at the back of the ship The underside of 10179 was built like a box with stud oriented up stuck onto the undercarriage of the Technic frame only with the sheer clutch power of the studs themselves If the interior sections were a hint of how different 75192 is from 10179 the rear underside is your next big clue The designers gave as much attention to the exterior detailing of the rear underside as they did to the upper hull  no mean feat given the dearth of publicly available reference materials about what the Falcon looks like underneath The large hull panel wraps around the underside of the interior sections and has all the details that the corresponding upper section has from the vertical fins fuel drive pressure stabilizers to various unnamed greebles The rear hull section attaches to t he Technic frame with clips and rests neatly on the previously attached lower hull sections angling gently up with another set of clipbar connections The next subassemblies build the frame and greeble sandwich  center for the curved hull sections behind the round airlocks on either side of the vessel The port and starboard segments are identical which means that they re inverted from each other on either side The blue glow of the sublight engines is achieved with long transblue tubes attached to Technic pins framed by pirate ship rigging in light gray This leaves a visible gap between the tubes and the rigging detracting from the grid effect on the real  ship that I m sure the designers were aiming for In 10179 the sublight engines were fully brickbuilt with a grid of 1 2 transblue tiles and I have to question whether the tubingandrigging solution in 75192 was a shortcut to save on parts count after investing in a detailed interior detailed underside and even more detail on top Either way it s a bit of a disappointing design solution The Millennium Falcon truly begins taking recognizable shape in the sixth set of bags which add the frame for the instantly recognizable forward mandibles Unlike the shorter sections behind the airlocks the mandible frames are neither identical x2 builds nor mirrored  the greebles are subtly different on either side and they look more  purposeful than the alternating jumper plates and 1 2 plates with bars on 10179 We re now in the seventh set of bags on step 471 nearly 200 pages into the instruction book The seventh bags include the parts for the forward mandibles  lower hulls including round holes for the four equipment access bays The 2007 UCS Falcon did have exposed equipment access bays on the underside but they were built from standard castle  arches and considerably cruder than the smoothly curved access bays on the new Falcon The bags numbered 8 add another set of underside hull sections built again from plates and Technic beams connected to the frame with pins and axles plus the exposed machinery in the equipment access bays on the mandibles Each of the exposed sections has different greebles so you end up building four panels on bricks with greebles on either side attached sideways above the holes in the lower hull The ninth bags add a small section of exposed machinery behind the starboard mandible along with the top covers for the mandibles themselves The top covers are similar to the lower hull sections with smoothly curved equipment access bays As I attached the top covers for the mandibles to their frames I felt like the Falcon was finally starting to show itself Bar pieces and flextubing create numerous exposed pipes and tubes across the surface and several of them drop down into the equipment bays In what seems like a bit of an odd choice with stickers used elsewhere a pair of 2 x 4 x 23 rounded slopes are printed and attach from the greeble sandwich  on the frame up over the upper section of the mandibles on droid arms Much of the rest of the build from bag groups 10 through 15 add exterior hull sections built from subassemblies of layered plates so we ll go through them fairly quickly and with large pieces like wedge plates I spent most of my time attaching greebles and doublechecking when I encountered extra pieces I shouldn t have had left over at the end of a bag group The tenth and eleventh bag groups include the parts for the four angular sections of hull that span the central section of the Falcon out to the port and starboard airlocks together with the boarding ramp underneath the starboard side Other than the one section with the boarding ramp these are largely simple builds with halfstudded 4 6 plates attached with Technic pins to the roof  The boarding ramp looks like the other sections from the outside but has some interesting Technic mechanisms to lower and raise the ramp The subassembly feels a little wobbly until you attach it to the underside at which point it becomes rock solid and the ramp moves up and down smoothly on Technic friction pins without flopping down Bags 10 also contain the pieces for the lower quad cannon emplacement  another major upgrade from 10179 The quad cannon s ring mount is almost fully circular thanks to the various rounded slopes LEGO has released in the last 10 years and the window uses a TIE fighter canopy rather than an open  webbed  8 8 radar dish There are hardcore SNOT Studs Not on Top techniques built into the upper and lower ring mounts in order to achieve the outwardfacing curves along with attachment points for exterior greebles and the attachment point for the quad cannon itself The whole assembly slides up into the frame and attaches with Technic pins on liftarms Finn and BB8 join the party in the twelfth set of bags which build much of the rear upper hull The heat exhaust vents are also remarkably different from 10179 where they were built from webbed 6 6 radar dishes surrounded by 4 4 curved macaroni  pieces In the new UCS Falcon a layer of 1 2 grill pieces is sandwiched between 4 4 curved corner plates and 4 4 quartercircle tiles That s a difference of 5 pieces vs 32 and thus the level of detail and movie accuracy is radically higher in the new version Two more upper hull sections drop over the rear of the Falcon with removable subsections to access the compartment with an interior Each section includes a hole where the machinery built onto the Technic frame can show through Bag group 13 adds the remainder of the rear upper hull including the final pair of exhaust vents on either side The fuel drive pressure stabilizer fins match the corresponding details on the underside Partway through the thirteenth group of bags I crossed step 1000 in the instruction book which felt like a milestone worth noting as a life accomplishment that should be written into history books a hundred years from now The fourteenth set of bags is another hull section adding the sloped section above the central freightloading room and concussion missile tubes as well as wings  to either side that cover part of the front upper hull Like the sections around the portstarboard airlocks and each of the rear hull sections every new hull section makes the Falcon begin coming alive but stacking plates and adding greebles isn t very interesting to read or write about The wings attach to the central sloped section with clips on bars and angle down over the hull Bag group 15 includes a lengthy 2x build of the circular airlocks to port and starboard and use curved slopes built SNOTwise with an inset section surrounded by quartercircle tiles to achieve a much more realistic look than the inverted 2 3 slopes that had huge gaps between them on 10179 After finishing the airlocks and a brief fourstep subbuild for the base of the main sensor rectenna there s another set of hull panels to cover the forward interior section with another removable cover to access the inside of the ship Old Han comes home in the sixteenth nexttolast set of bags along with Rey whom I hope will get a surname in The Last Jedi  These bags finally have the parts for the cockpit and its tunnel to the main saucer section shoutout to Star Trek fans reading this The cockpit itself relies heavily on brackets angled in various directions to attach the front canopy and rounded hull The canopy uses two new transclear printed pieces The rear of the cockpit section and tunnel back to the main hull is composed of sections of plates with curved slopes attached with Technic pins The whole assembly attaches with another set of Technic pins to the core frame and the upper section of the tunnel slots onto an angled beam attached farther back There s a spine  of greebles along the top of the cockpit tunnel A vague sense of impending loss hung over me as I opened the final set of bags I d spent every available spare minute over the past week building the new UCS Falcon and the herculean effort was about to come to an end  somewhere between 17 and 20 hours maybe more Bag group 17 begins with the mynock further reinforcing the LEGO designers  stated intent to depict the Falcon from Episode V A couple small sections fill the final gaps in the surface of the upper hull followed by the upper quad cannon emplacement which is mostly identical to the lower emplacement with some differences in coloring including a pair of stickers to extend a section of dark red onto light gray bricks The whole emplacement fits li ke a cap over the hole that contains the gunner s seat The quad cannon itself swivels smoothly on its mount over the viewport The final bag also includes the two variations that enable you to build both the Episode V and Episode VII Falcon  the round vs rectangular sensor dishes and a pair of small details on the very front of the mandibles The very last steps assemble the standard UCS specification card on its black stand ending with step 1379 The minifigs  creatures 75192 Millennium Falcon includes ten minifigs in two groups  one batch from The Empire Strikes Back  and a second batch from The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi  Han Solo and Princess Leia wear their outfits first seen on Hoth For the first time they each have reversible heads with breathing masks to supplement the atmosphere on the insides of an asteroidadapted space slug They re accompanied by Chewbacca and C3PO to round out the ESB asteroid belt crew The Force Awakens is represented by veteran smuggler  old Han Solo Rey Finn and BB8 These minifigs add a different angle to the set but are largely similar to the ones from previous sets released within the past two years Each character has a reversible head with two different expressions which are new but the torso and leg printing is close enough to previous versions that I can t tell the difference To represent The Last Jedi without giving too much away the set also includes a pair of birdlike porgs which have a new print on BB8 s head piece and are quite cute Mynocks are flighty creatures you don t really get a good look at in Empire Strikes Back  so I can t say that the brickbuilt mynock is instantly recognizable out of context but with batlike wings and a sucker mouth it s right at home trying to eat through power cables on the hull of the LEGO Falcon The finished model I think we ve established by this point that this is the largest LEGO set ever released But just for good measure it measures over 8  high 33  long and 22  wide 21 x 84 x 56 cm But honestly size and scale are not what we should remember this set for over the coming years as we look back at the greatest LEGO sets ever released Any collection of bricks can simply be huge massive monstrous and so on but it takes something special to make a LEGO set great epic awesome etc If I wasn t being 100 clear I ll try to be less circumspect 75192 UCS Millennium Falcon is a truly spectacular LEGO set Over the past 25 years I ve pored over multiple reference books and of course I ve been watching the movies all my life I can t think of ways to make a LEGO Millennium Falcon more accurate from an exterior standpoint short of increasing the scale even more or adding electronic features like moving quad cannons or working lights That said the proportions are not 100 perfect as this comparison of 75192 in the center against 10179 on the left and the movie Millennium Falcon on the right illustrates The available LEGO wedge plates make the mandibles slightly too short the airlocks are just a bit too big and the shortened mandibles have the equipment access bays a little farther back than on the real thing The biggest difference is set of six exhaust vents near the stern which are all much too large on both LEGO versions Unfortunately I susp ect that LEGO just won t ever make circular pieces in an odd lengthwidth that would happen to fit perfectly on the Falcon Regardless it s a remarkable likeness and the angle and size of the cockpit with its access tunnel is especially spoton Photo montage by TBB contributor Edwinder Singh Source image credits Flickr user STICK KIM 10179 the LEGO Group 75192 and LucasfilmSimon  Schuster movie version One big opportunity for builders to improve the new UCS Falcon is to fill the two empty interior compartments on the starboard side of the ship Forward cargo hold 2 sits behind the right mandible intersected at an angle by the cockpit access tunnel The rear starboard compartment should have another engineering station more engine details and at least one of the escape pod s that occupy this LEGO Falcon s crew compartment area on the port side Get building and share your pictures of your UCS Falcon mods Every LEGO set includes play features and it s evident that this set is truly intended for adult builders  there s not a single studshooter or springloaded missile anywhere in the set This Falcon is more of a playset with interior sections to recreate static scenes rather than functions for roleplaying Nevertheless there are a few really cool play  features from the loading ramp I mentioned previously to the ground buzzer  surface defense blaster that pops down from the underside As noted earlier during the build the set includes parts for both the Empire Strikes Back and Force Awakens versions of the Falcon mainly distinguished by the different sensor rectenna At the end of Return of the Jedi  Lando pilots the Falcon through the second Death Star and whacks off the round dish so the older Falcon seen in Episode VII has a replacement dish that s square Another difference is much more subtle The tractor beam projectors at the very front of the mandibles are different in the two versions of the Falcon so there s a small subassembly that you can attach to the Episode V Falcon to turn it into the Episode VII Falcon We ve been comparing 75192 Millennium Falcon mainly to the previous UCS Falcon 10179 But it s also fascinating to see how LEGO Millennium Falcon designs have evolved in the 18 years since the LEGO Star Wars theme launched in 1999 LEGO released its first Millennium Falcon in 2000 using rounded panels from the LEGO Space theme s UFO line released a couple years previously Early LEGO Star Wars sets were almost entirely lacking in detail and the overall shape wasn t really correct until LEGO created new wedge plates for subsequent LEGO Falcon sets Conclusions philosophical musings and recommendation Like a Toyota sedan or a can of CocaCola LEGO is a massmarket product  the company is frequently the top toy company by revenue in the world with products ranging from a few dollars for a Collectible Minifigure to 16 sets like the annual release of new modular buildings But companies also produce products that only a small subset of their customer base can actually afford like the limitedrun supercars that manufacturers like Volkswagen prod uce for the world s billionaires Fewer than 500 Bugatti Veyron supercars were delivered during the vehicle s tenyear production run These products are prestige  products that set the company apart from its competitors showcasing their design and engineering expertise I feel like the same is true of LEGO sets like 70620 Ninjago City and 75192 Millennium Falcon Unless you win it from TBB s LEGO Millennium Falcon Contest or some other contest most of you reading this review will probably never own this set As a daring act of pure LEGO engineering prowess the new UCS Falcon is a monumental achievement But as a consumer product I have to question whether dropping 800 on 7500 mostly gray bricks is the best investment in parts I m consciously ignoring the secondary speculatorcollector market  more UCS Falcons will be hitting LEGO stores on October 1st but if you have 2500 to waste in order to buy an 800 set a week or two earlier you can find them on eBay and Bricklink today I also feel compelled to question whether dropping 800 on any LEGO set is the right way to spend that kind of money And let me be clear By the right way  I mean ethically morally  A steady trickle of impulse purchases and investments in parts for custom models MOCs or my own creations  surely adds up to far more than 800 for the average LEGO fan over the course of any given year But in the context of broader world events and the state of society around us  and I don t say this lightly and I know I m going to get hit hard in the comments section by readers who take their ethical queues from Ayn Rand rather than Martin Buber for even suggesting this  doesn t it seem like there are more important and valuable ways to spend 800 all at once than purposefully consciously intentionally blowing that kind of money on something like a UCS Falcon Like a Bugatti Veyron for billionaires it smacks of privilege and the very idea makes this cardcarrying bleeding heart cringe  not least because I feel more than a little bit like a hypocrite myself You can argue that some of the money trickles down to the designers factory workers and retail employees but how much of every 800 UCS Falcon goes into the pockets of Denmark s wealthiest family so that someone with the surname Kristiansen can add to a fleet of Ferraris It all feels slightly obscene like the beauty of pure science gone horribly awry But let s set aside my progressive guilt and selfrecrimination and return to the set itself I truly enjoy building LEGO Star Wars sets but my favorite LEGO sets more broadly are ones for which I don t have preconceived expectations like the recent Saturn V and Fishing Store  It would be hard to consider 75192 Millennium Falcon my favorite LEGO set of all time but it s undeniably one of the greatest and best  With a monumental scale that enabled the designers to add every conceivable detail including half an interior leaving space for fans to supplement their own UCS Falcons it s hard to imagine how LEGO will be able to top this set any time soon If 800 and the necessary space to store either the finished model or 7500 more LEGO pieces aren t particularly thoughtprovoking I genuinely hope you get as much pleasure from building this fantastic LEGO set  superlative in just about every way  as I did over this past week 75192 Ultimate Collector s Millennium Falcon will be available again for the general public starting on October 1st retailing for 79999 in the United States 64999 in the United Kingdom and 79999 in the European Union likely more elsewhere like Canada and Australia The LEGO Group sent The Brothers Brick an early copy of this set for review Providing TBB with products for

I might spend that much in a year but it s mostly second hand with the additions of a few new sets Dropping it at one time seems extreme It is just plastic Anyway thanks for running a great site I check a few times a day to see what s new Keep it up everyone Scott Normington September 20 2017 at 712 pm How Did it hold toegther when being moved I have the original UCS Falcon and it s almost impossible to move without something falling off Don September 20 2017 at 907 pm Great review I have considered saving up and buying one but hadn t thought about the space requirements of actually owningdisplaying it  And good call on the philosophical musings Andrew Post author September 20 2017 at 947 pm Steve  Don Thanks for your kind words  I was more than a little worried I d be immediately jumped for expressing such uh heresy Don We moved the Falcon between my place where I built it and Chris s place for photography with a side jaunt for dinner and it held together perfectly It s incredibly sturdy Kalekko September 21 2017 at 1211 am Hi Thanks for a nice review You have made a mistake putting the Falcon together though There shouldn t be so many tan studs showing at the root  of the mandibles Check out the official pics and you will see Guy Whitlock September 21 2017 at 126 am Great review I myself queued to buy the bloody thing with nowhere to put it when it s built Although I desperately wanted the original when I was a wee lad and obviously couldn t get it so being able to own the new one is fulfilling somewhat of a childhood dream for me Interesting points raised on the moral aspect but for me it just boils down to living in a capitalist society If I didn t spend 650 quid on this I d have potentially bought a new phone my current one is fine really so that would ve been excess itself alcohol on nights out or other materialistic goods Could have put it towards saving for a mortgage or a cardriving lessons but again it s all just material goods I believe if someone works hard for their money they should be free to spend it however they please after all we re all part of the corporate machine whether we like it or not Allen September 21 2017 at 711 am I m thankfully at a state in my life that I can afford it  and I want it but 800 seems so obscene Basically for the reasons you pointed out Great review and great site Thanks Jalkow September 21 2017 at 946 am Great review that threeparted comparisonpicture is absolutely amazing guys Your final words on the pricetag are spoton too it s great to read a statement like this in the afolcommunity It s also the reason why some reviews on YouTube hosted by kids got my attention I dunno just a bit weird tot watch Alan September 21 2017 at 1011 am Thanks for this fantastic review There were a lot of great insights here especially the comparison of the proportions of the different versions And the conclusion was very thoughtful Great post Although I do enjoy collecting UCS Star Wars sets I almost certainly won t be getting this one for a variety of reasons Eugene September 21 2017 at 1013 am Thank you for an informative review I am not terribly interested in the Falcon To me the original design looks like a not terribly attractive mesh of a flying saucer with a WWII bomber I also think that there is something disturbing about TLG releasing a set that costs more than most smart phones James September 21 2017 at 1106 am People keep saying about it costing more than a smart phone but a smart phone always decreases in value and worth a lot less years down the line were as this will at least hold its value so in the end more money is wasted on keeping with the latest smart phones Hkan September 21 2017 at 1113 am I feel it s doubtful if Lego as an investment will hold up in the long run James B Kramer September 21 2017 at 130 pm I hope you don t feel too guilty about spending 800 on a lot of little plastic bits Because in light of all the problems in the world and they will always be there I think it s a better place with Lego in it I ll happily spend my money on a Danish toy company that gives me a few hours or days of happiness and peace then all the other useless things I spend my money on Purple Dave September 21 2017 at 633 pm I don t remember who it was but the first person to make a minifigscale Falcon almost 15 years ago did a bit of research He compared scenes from the movies and schematics from several different sources What he found was that nobody actually made a logical blueprint of the interior and everyone just put things wherever they feel like With no less than three schematics I kn ow one was WEG I think one was from a coffee table book and I can t remember what else might have been available they were all in total disagreement with each other The interior shots he was unable to piece together into an overall interior layout that was physically possible much less one that actually agreed with any published interior schematic at that point And this was research he did in order to actually cobble together the firs t UCSscale MF in the world on an AFOL s budget and limited part selection not just to critique someone else s design So I can t help but chuckle when reading about how they put interior sections in the wrong place when we really can t prove much of anything that doesn t have a window to the outside world to match it up by By my count the only such interior section that was missing from 10179 is the ventral gun turret Tim September 21 2017 at 657 pm I m embarrassed to admit that when I saw the AUS 1300 price tag I didn t think twice Of course I was going to get it I almost choked on my sandwich and I may have had a little cry a bit later on but I didn t hesitate It is a ridiculous amount of money to spend on one set but I ve wasted more money on dumber things in the past to be honest jimmy September 22 2017 at 505 pm The floor of the rear compartment has a 14 plate that is removable presumably to reenact smuggling activities not shown on screen in the Classic Trilogy or the scene in The Force Awakens when Rey Finn and BB8 try to hide from Han and Chewie  Isn t this from the Asteroid field Han is down there trying to fix the hyperdrive you know bring me the hydrospanner  jimmy September 22 2017 at 521 pm RE spending 800 on plastic bricks I still have a bunch of bricks from when I was a kid that I will eventually pass to my own daughter They re pushing 35 years old without undue signs of wear I can t really think of many other things I ve spent money on that have given that kind of value those countless hours of constructive play Scott D October 16 2017 at 238 pm Fantastic review I ve read them all and yours is the best Comments are closed Support the Brothers Brick documentwritea

Contact Us Search 75827 LEGO Ghostbusters Firehouse Headquarters Review Happy New Year LEGO sent us 75827 Ghostbusters Firehouse Headquarters  and I am pleased to end the year by giving you this review This set available January 1 2016 has 4634 pieces and retails for 34999 It features the Firehouse and eight minifigures and four small ghost figures including Slimer Saying the set is massive is a bit of an understatement This set has the third most pieces of any LEGO set ever made To give you an idea I present you the box with my cat Athena for scale The set features bags numbered 114 with an average of 3 bags per number Make sure you have a garbage can near you during your build process since disposing of 40 or more plastic bags generates quite the mess Opening the box you have boxception with two unprinted boxes inside the main box the instruction manual a 32 32 grey baseplate and a number of loose bags at the bottom One box contains numbers 14 and the 16 32 baseplate The second box contains numbers 57 with some plates and the fire pole Numbers 814 are in the main box The instruction manual is lovely and hefty at 418 pages The opening pages feature a summary of the movie and the importance of the set before diving into instructions I would prefer instructions of this size be spiral bound in general though I did not have any issues keeping the book open to the proper page I didn t have an problem with pages falling out either like I have with previous large instruction manuals bound this way The minifigures are spread throughout the bag groups Each minifigure has dualprinted heads and Louis Tully actually has two heads The second head features a printed on handle for the bucket he wears The minifigures for the Ghostbusters themselves are different than those featured in 21108 IDEAS Ghostbusters Ecto1  All of the Firehouse Ghostbuster torsos have elbow pads an arm pocket and the Ghostbusters logo printed on the arms Peter has a new hair piece unique to this set with a new torsohead print Unlike Ecto Peter the Firehouse Peter is covered in slime Ecto Raymond and Firehouse Raymond are identical exception for the previously mentioned arm printing Egon has a slightly different face The Ecto Egon is looking straighton through his glasses Firehouse Egon seems to be glancing left though this might be a printing error Firehouse Winston has a new hairpiece unique to this set Back Row Ecto Ghostbusters Front Row Firehouse Ghostbusters I am very impressed with this set The build though time consuming has been a wonderful experience There are plenty of excellent techniques I feel less like I m building a set and more like I m creating a build of my own Each wall is two studs wide allowing for detailed outside colors and completely different interior In addition to the new hair pieces for the minifigures there are a number of new parts in this set including 1X5X6 Panel  black with corrugated texture 1 1 round tile with pin in pearl gold 1x4x6 Door with 3 panes in brown and dark brown 1x2x1 Double corner panel two of the 1 1 corner panels together This set does include stickers This includes the mirrored silver stickers which LEGO has always made as stickers Some were things that should have been printed including the Ghostbusters iconic logo This was a sticker placed on a 2 2 white tile and 2 2 inverted white tile Other 2 2 tiles including a magazine cover were printed I don t understand why the decision was made to not print the Ghostbusters logo In the Ecto1 set even the curved 2 2 slopes were printed First Floor The first four bags groups are dedicated to building the first floor which is quiet impressive The desks toolbox lamp and boxes make their appearance The windows are all recessed by half a stud which looks excellent and adds to the overall visual accuracy The interior uses dark green as its main color and has the shelving across the entire back wall The main doors ar e brick built with the black doorframe coming to the party late in bag group 3 Being brick built adds an extra level of detail One detail I particularly like is the pink slime leaking out on the sidewalk I remember the pink slime vividly from the movies when I was a kid and appreciated seeing it incorporated into the build This set features the premolded staircase that is very familiar to the Castle and City themes The set uses 1 2 inverted brown slopes to smooth out the visible edge which I hadn t seen used in a set previously Second Floor The second floor has some interesting details the sink for example uses the studs sideways and does not connect to the rest of the model using a stud connection For stability one of the corners uses a telescope piece that s completely hidden The kitchen is very detailed with a fantastic fridge and arcade machine The sink u ses the new double corner panel and isn t attached by studs at all and is quite effective There are plenty of healthy options including pizza and a soda in a red can The second floor bathroom is awfully messy and I suspect Slimer is at work The shower and toilet are clever and detailed I don t like the fact that there is no wall between the beds and toilet however I understand that it s a space issue in the model and when the firehouse is open it doesn t make a difference But after the rest of attention to detail in the model this just stuck out Third Floor and Roof The third floor features shelving with instruments a computer a coffee table and a pool table The pool table is rather clever and full of excellent techniques including a studsnotontop design The coffee table securely attaches to the floor diagonally using jumper plates The fireman s pole is attached to the third and first floors and is added as one of the final steps The roof is designed to open on the side just the same as the rest of the building and is solidly attached to the model Each portion that opens seals with a clip and rod and helps make the set very solid when moved preventing the sides from swinging open which they did during building every time I had to move it Overall this set is fantastic It s full of great details the sort of that adult fans would put into their own creations It has interesting techniques for minifigscale items and just feels complete I appreciate that with the immense size of this set very little felt repetitive during the build process even with the tilemodified bricks with studs on the side design for the windows I appreciate the conti nuity with the Ecto1 fitting perfectly inside It was understandably a very long build We re talking a full marathon of Lord of the Rings  Extended Edition build length If you choose to build this and I hope you do be prepared for the long haul and make sure you ve got good lighting and a decent chair You ll find the result well worth your time You can check out all of our pictures on flickr  Here at The Brothers Brick we recognize there s been a lot of conversation in the LEGO community regarding this set and a similar submission on IDEAS We reviewed this as a set and won t be making further comments regarding this topic Like

Contact Us Search The LEGO Ninjago Movie s largest set 70620 Ninjago City Review The list of largest LEGO sets ever produced is dominated by Star Wars and Architecture sets with the likes of the Ultimate Collector s Series Millennium Falcon and the Taj Mahal topping the charts Now though LEGO s homebrewed Ninjago theme is proving to be a serious contender Having already brought us two sets over the 2000 piece mark the Temple of Airjitzu and Destiny s Bounty  Ninjago s latest entry has an incredible 4867 pieces skyrocketing 70620 Ninjago City to the thirdlargest LEGO set ever created From left Senior Editor Chris Malloy and Founder and EditorinChief Andrew Becraft with 70620 Ninjago City The primary locale in The LEGO Ninjago Movie which opens September 22 Ninjago City is an Easterninspired cyberpunk city brimming with action and loaded with hidden details 70620 Ninjago City will be available to VIP members in the LEGO Shop Online and in LEGO stores Aug 16 for 29999 USD and will be available to everyone Sept 1 The Ninjago City set builds on the work of the asyetunreleased The LEGO Ninjago Movie  and is a partnership of the film designers and LEGO s model designers Several designers were responsible for translating the concept art into brick form but Christopher Leslie Stamp and Nicolaas Vs took the lead Nico will be familiar to readers of this site having graced our pages many times for his personal creations  The box Befitting the set s part count the box is a massive affair weighing in at 138 lbs One side panel pictures the 17 named minifigures the two manikins aren t shown while the back shows an exploded view of the city s three main levels and their play features Inside the outer box are a multitude of numbered parts bags a sealed bag with the instruction manuals and sticker sheets and two smaller boxes each large enough to be a standard 1000pluspiece set in their own right The bags are numbered 115 and each number has at minimum three bags Annoyingly the inner boxes are unmarked though I discovered one contained the bag numbers 15 and the other bag numbers 6 7 8 and 10 but not 9 Consequently you ll need to open both boxes and then sort the nearly50 bags before beginning In the below photo the inner boxes aren t even open yet The build There are three instruction manuals one for each level of Ninjago City The covers show a sepiatoned image of the set with the corresponding segment in full color In total they span 533 pages Book 1 opens with an extensive introduction to the set and setting including designer interviews ala the Ultimate Collector s Sets There s also an interview with the movie director and a translation guide to Ninjago s faux scriptsomething fans had long ago worked out though it s nice to see it confirmed and the rarelyused letters translated Ninjago City is nothing if not welldecorated Two enormous sticker sheets will plaster every available space with decorative text or ornamentation It s no secret I m not a fan of stickers and that s no different here I d estimate I spent at least 30 minutes of the build time tediously applying stickers to tile after tile carefully ensuring each decal is centered and lint and bubblefree The comic shop s sale window decoration is a perfect example of why stickers are always inferior to printing no matter how scrupulously applied a sticker will never look as good on a transparent window as printing Nevertheless the art here is superb and many of these decorations are among my favorites LEGO has ever produced The Godzillainspired film poster for Return of the Brick Separator  featuring a monstrous brick separator menacing the city is absolutely magnificent Book 1 is for the Old City which is the first two stories and the base Each instruction book opens with an introduction to the level and brief character biographies for the minifigures The city sits on a dark grey 32 32 baseplate a remarkably humble footprint for the thirdlargest LEGO set Onto the base a layer of plates are applied to give subtle color to the water A deep black channel runs through the middle of the canal making extensive use of wedge plates laid angle to angle Next up the water Two entire bags are dedicated to trans light blue 1 2 tiles with more sprinkled in other bags Some steps call for placing more than 70 of the tiles at a time which isn t difficult but does require careful attention to match the pattern which has the tiles interspersed with trans light blue 1 1 platesAll told you ll place 219 water tiles The finished effect is striking This technique of plates beneath tiles has long been employed by fans but has always required too many pieces to find its way into an official set Here we can also see the basic foundations for the buildings which occupy an even tinier footprint on this already small baseplate In the right corner there s also the base of the prominent front column cleverly locked into a 45degree angle The cleaning robot Sweep has a small domicile on the ground floor The new 2 2 half tile elements are put to excellent use interspersing doublelong cheese slopes to make wood siding There s also a wood dock made with brown Technic pin connectors and jumbled stone stairs for the sidewalks The bridge over the canal uses minifigure neck brackets as a structural element another great technique common in fan designs that I can t recall having observed in an official set before And of course the artist s palette makes a debut in green as lily pads which is such a perfect use that it s a wonder it s never been done before Also worth noting is the rockwork around the bridge s foundations with multiple pieces on a halfstud offset It s a tiny detail that could have been easily left out but its presence is an early herald of the care designers took in this set The market stall includes one of the more intriguing techniques in the set a gently curved awning made of minifigure crowbars After seeing the initial photos of this set I had numerous discussions with other fans about how the curve would be created In a fan model each crowbar would be carefully positioned individually relying on steady hands LEGO designers have found a much more simple solution the crowbars rest on a length of Technic flex tube which is made of softer plastic and naturally bows when pressed A quick run of your finger across the crowbars and the curve is perfectly set Brilliant Each of the second story rooms is built individually and can be removed separately They re no less detailed however This room features a sleeping mat television and dresser along with a lovely round window At the end of Book 1 the cityscape is beginning to take form The elevator shaft on the right is firmly in place and each of the main buildings has two floors Pages of concept art are interwoven throughout the instruction manuals giving insight to early designs of the structures and providing some great color I sincerely wish all LEGO manuals included this regardless of theme or set size The second and third books build their levels as standalones with a rigid structure of Technic bricks undergirding the plates The crab shack includes what is unquestionably my favorite technique stuffing 1 1 round tiles inside a 1x2x5 transparent column for a decorative fixture It can be a little tedious to get the proper rightleftright orientation the tiles kept wanting to go leftrightleft but this is so far outside what I ve come to expect from a LEGO set that I m more than happy to play along Next door the comic book shop also gets some nifty handiwork with a brickbuilt sign The sign employs printed 1 1 plates for the i and s and the result is highly readable especially considering that this is smaller than most other designs for brickbuilt lettering Up on the top level vehicle doors make a sweeping roof held firmly in place by headlight bricks Thankfully two segments employ this technique meaning each door comes in a matched set of leftright The parts A number of new parts find their way into this set We already covered the 2 2 half tile plates in the Destiny s Bounty review  and you ll get 22 in brown and four in black in this set In no particular order we ll cover some of the other most interesting elements This 1 1 white plate is used for the comic book shop s lettering Although only three are visible in the finished design all of the plates in that step are printed My first thought on seeing them is that they d make perfect largescale character eyes and it would be quite easy to substitute all but the three visible plates for standard 1 1 plates if you intend to display Ninjago City but still want these parts The set includes 11 plus an extra We encountered these new 1x1x2 bricks with side studs in our Temple of the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon review last month but here they re in brown for the first time with a total of seven included New doublelong jumper tiles These will be tremendously useful in a variety of applications and they allow halfstud offsets on the bottom following the recent redesign of the jumper tile Four are included The new fence element looks fantastic The horizontal bar can be grasped by any clip and the pattern matches when two fences are placed next to each other The outer dimensions of the fence match that of the previous columned fences 28 black fences are included in Ninjago City  Particularly eagleeyed readers may spy a lone old style fence in the set which I subbed in when I temporarily misplaced one of these new ones during construction  This new element may be my favorite I m calling it an espresso filter since it s a perfect minifigurescale barista tool but on a more pragmatic level it s a 1 1 round plate with a horizontal bar My only complaint is that the hollow stud isn t completely open Our friends at New Elementary have a great writeup of this element of which Ninjago City employs seven plus a spare A new sixbrick tall macaroni piece aka onequarter of a 4 4 circle made its debut in Elves sets earlier this year but will likely be unfamiliar to many builders Eight are used in sand green for the top spire Finally while microfigures are not new elements they are highly sought after Ninjago City features seven colors of unprinted microfigures and a spare is included for each color giving a small army s worth at 14 total The set Now that we ve built the entire structure from the ground up let s start at the top and work our way down to the old city looking at the finished set Ninjago City is quite a highrise topping two feet to the tip of the antenna Full of vibrant color and action it looks the part of a bustling metropolis reminding me of my visit to Hong Kong Despite the rainbow of hues the various structures form a cohesive and pleasing sum While the structure is divided into three main levels Ninjago City really includes five distinct stories with individual rooms that can be accessed and removed plus the two levels of the sand green tower While the back is definitely more subdued than the racous front streets it still evokes its urban inspiration and has plenty of detail The elevator on the right side spans all three levels and is manually raised and lowered relying on friction to hold it in place The rooftop sushi restaurant has a bar and three tables for patrons along with a station for the sushi chef The sushi is on a conveyor belt and turning the center light makes the belt move The belt uses no LEGO track or conveyor belt elements but is made of 1 2 Technic beams arranged in a chain The conveyor belt occasionally hits a snag but is probably the best solution short of a new element Both the puffer fish and the squid are genius designs though for precisely opposite reasons The pufferfish is a magnificently complex sphere of precisely arranged 2 2 radar dishes while the squid is an astonishingly elegant and simple design The central tower includes a small washroom in the lower level with one of the city s many sliding ricepaper doors The washroom level is also removable revealing a small cubby for the crab cook Severin Black s disguise for when he s moonlighting as the sushi chef Presumably this will make more sense once I ve seen The LEGO Ninjago Movie  Next door is Lloyd s house which has a pair of bunk beds with the top one removable for access Despite the tinyhome proportions it s packed with detail including a nifty bit of design to attach all the stacked books in the shelves made of empty window frames There s also a portrait on the wall in each bunk made of a stickered tan window pane This is only the third nontransparent color for the window pane following white and dark blue Every building in Ninjago City is accessible to minifigures though some require more agility than others Lloyd s home can be accessed by a metal grate walkway and a ladder The top level is removed independently from Lloyd s home which is a small standalone structure resting atop the second level The second level is split into two stories which can be removed separately Below the sushi restaurant is a fancy shop selling clothes smartphones and other goods Look closely and space fans might spy a familiar sign The shop also has two manikins in the windows modeling clothing Next door to the shop is the overgrown construction area beneath Lloyd s house A beautiful bonsai tree is growing of the window The roots of the tree are inside the abandoned building which is the only room not accessible by a platform Out back a tree root has even found its way down through the drainpipes Removing the upper story of the second level gives access to the comic shop and crab shack This level which is the street level has a full walkway around the stuctures ringed with a fence covered in signage advertising various cyberpunk businesses many using the Ninjago text The crab shack features a large crab over the door greeting patrons On the left side the elevator tower serves as a movie poster board In a nod to what was perhaps LEGO s most illfated theme the graphic designers have included a poster for a Galidor film The sign on the right side of the column can be pushed to reveal three more movie posters allowing them to be swapped out The crab shack has a small counter and a few stools along with with a kitchen stocked with trays of bananas both yellow and gold and various heavy duty tools for cracking crabs Air conditioning units sit above each side window in fact most of the buildings in Ninjago City have great little details like AC units The main play feature here is the large crab grill Insert an orange raw crab close the lid and give the handle outside a spin When you open the grill back up a tan cooked crab will now be in its place It s quite a nifty mechanism and I d be surprised if it doesn t turn up again in a future set Next door there s an ATM sandwiched between the crab shack and the comic book store Pushing a lever on the building s back ejects a 100 bill no PIN required Of course you can also yank the ATM off its footing to get to the fat stacks of cash inside the machine or to refill the machine if you re the lawfulgood type The set includes 15 100 bill tiles The comic shop come apart in two sections The top threebrick tall segment which includes the front lettering can be removed to allow better access to the shop s tiny floor Just like a real comic shop though the top shelves are stuffed with trinkets There s also my favorite LEGO poster of all time which fans will recognize from The LEGO Movie  I m reasonably sure I ve been in real life comic shops with less room to maneuver than this one affords but nonetheless it s a tight squeeze between the stacks of comics and the shelves of action figures Mother Doomsday the proprietor is also a Galidor fan and sports a shirt bearing the logo The comics are all references to other LEGO properties from Fabuland to Adventurers In back is a rack of scifi magazines one of the few uniquely printed elements in this set Four are included Removing this layer brings us down to the old city with only the bottom two stories remaining The elevator shaft has no more removable segments while each of the other two structures can be removed independently The middle building has a small tea room outfitted with a table mat and potted plant made of Sabine Wren s hairpiece in bright green The room next door was pictured during the construction phase so I won t cover it again here Finally the bottom two rooms which are the market stall and the robot s storage closet Both rooms are uncharacteristically sparse with no details inside apart from the stall s racks of seafood and the robot s lone poster There is a small boat included and it s a solid build but not particularly noteworthy The minifigures According to LEGO Ninjago City includes 16 minifigures or 17 if you count Sweep the robot However the two manikins are full minifigures with unprinted yellow heads so I d say they count for a total of 19 minifigures That s almost as many as the entire Collectible Minifigures line The figures are not as detailed as those in the CMF line but they are quite nice anyway Below from left are Sweep Misako Kai Jamanakai Villager and Ivy Walker From left Manikin 1 Manikin 2 Severin Black Green Ninja Suit and Lloyd Garmadon From left Jay Juno Konrad Sally and Mother Doomsday From left Shark Army Gunner Guy Tommy and Officer Noonan Conclusion and recommendation 70620 Ninjago City is huge Really huge To see just how big it is I put it next to 10255 Assembly Square  LEGO s largest modular which has 4002 pieces Ninjago City has connections on both back edges for attaching it to the modular buildings so it fits rather well Perhaps a few small tweaks might be in order to make the transition a little more smooth but the bigger issue is that Ninjago City positively dwarfs the modulars Assembly Square is a massive set yet it looks rather small next to Ninjago City The standard line of modulars has always impressed me with its advanced construction but the nostalgic placid city theme has never interested me However Ninjago City is precisely what I ve always wanted it s a cyberpunk modularThis gorgeous structure is rich in details loaded with fun play features and tremendously rewarding to build No matter your expertise level you re sure to learn a few new techniques while building Ninjago City And even if you re just eyeing all the new parts at 299 Ninjago City is a mere 006 per piece or about 40 percent less than the average priceperpiece across LEGO sets Ninjago City is absolutely a mustbuy for any LEGO fan even if the Ninjago theme has never interested you beforeafter all only two of the 19 minifigures are ninjas I brought this set to a recent gathering of LEGO fans and we spent the better part of the afternoon poring over all its details and everyone loved some aspect of Ninjago City whether it was the finished set the techniques or simply the parts 70620 Ninjago City is available Aug 16 to LEGO VIP members in LEGO stores and on the LEGO Shop Online  and will be available to everyone Sept 1 It retails for 29999 USD The LEGO Group sent The Brothers Brick an early copy of this set for review Providing TBB with products for review guarantees neither coverage nor positive

Contact Us Search LEGO s biggest modular yet 10255 Assembly Square Review 2017 is a year of anniversaries for LEGO it marks 40 years for Technic  and the 10th year for LEGO s Modular Buildings These highly detailed sets clock in at over 2000 pieces and are most definitely fan favorites In October LEGO announced 10255 Assembly Square to celebrate the decennial anniversary of the line LEGO sent us an early copy so today we re pleased to bring you a full handson review It spacked full of Easter eggs celebrating 10 years of these fantastic sets and is the largest modular yetwith 4002 pieces 10255 Assembly Square is available now on The LEGO Shop for 27999 USD So just how impressive is this set Read on because we re going to tell you all about it Before we dive in let s take a look back at ten years of Modulars Prices listed are the original MSRP all in USD 2007 10182 Cafe Corner 2056 pieces  13999 2007 10190 Market Street  1248 pieces  8999 2008 10185 Green Grocer  2352 pieces  14999 2009

pieces  14999 2014 10243 Parisian Restaurant  2469 pieces  15999 2015 10246 Detective s Office  2262 pieces  15999 2016 10251 Brick Bank  2380 pieces  16999 Each of those sets is definitely a highlight of its year So how about the newest addition 2017 10255 Assembly Square  4002 pieces  27999 This behemoth is just shy of twice the size of the original modular Cafe Corner and priced over 100 more as well But don t let that dissuade you this set is worth every penny  in fact at around 007 per piece it s quite a bargain Here s the brand new Assembly Square lined up with its original ancestor they fit together perfectly The Box Assembly Square comes in a very substantial box much like other large sets we ve reviewed such as 75827 Ghostbusters Firehouse Headquarters  Inside are the numbered bags baseplates instruction manual and another large box containing even more numbered bags The box and its contents are pictured here with a reference cat for scale Both the front and back of the box feature a 10th Anniversary logo and the top displays thefull inventory Thankfully the box is big enough to show all the parts becausethere are a lot The Build The build takes several hours to fully construct There are 33 bags covering six segments and a single 306page instruction manual The minifigures are spread throughout the bags The first notable aspect is the intricately tiled sidewalks and floors Unlike past modulars the sidewalks are sprinkled with 1 1 plates allowing you to pose minifigures without fearing the gentlest bump will send them sprawling Assembly Square is made of numerous small apartments and businesses and comes apart into 7 individual pieces when fully expanded Let s dive into the sections one by one The Bakery is fullof detail There are four baked goodies in the oven and many on display The back wall features an assortment of very fancy cakes but the real jewel here is the threetiered wedding cake in the front window As far as I m aware this may be the first time LEGO has used stacked 1 1 round plates to represent minifigures in an official set The base is a round wheel hub which works really well as a fancy tiered wedding cake The oven door is all brickbuilt and ends up looking like a properly massive iron door The entryway uses some clever SNOT techniques making use of the 1 1 round tile with pin inkwells to invert the large semisphere over the door A similar technique was used to invert portions of the facade in 10253 Big Ben  The windows are made using garage door panels and the lights make use of the welder s torch to give a fancy look From the bakery there is a passage to the Flower Shop The Flower Shop is pretty small and the designers took this into account by designing a removable section in the back upper wall The shop uses a 1x4x1 lattice fence as a bouquetholder which is clever and effective The parrot hangs out here presumably greeting customers The Coffee Shop is light and airy with a few seats for indoor and outdoor seating The outdoor patio tables are made from Technic discs Inside you ll find a clever little espresso machine The back of the shop features the steps to get up to the second level for this building The Coffee Shop is attached to the Flower Shop by a nice plantcovered grate which also acts as a covering for the doorway to the stairs Both the Coffee Shop and the Bakery feature mosaics in the sidewalk using the new 2 2 angled tiles The center of the square has a fountain and the base has some nice mosaic work Sadly the fountain itself leaves something to be desired especially since it s one of the last things to be built in this otherwise highly detailed set The Dentist s office is quite nice although if it s in the USAHIPPA violations will abound since the dental exam is out in the open for everyone to listen to how you don t floss your teeth enough The front desk is very simple but effective with a phone and a few magazines As far as the exam area goes there are a lot of great details here to ogle The sink is great making use of a new piece a 1 2 45 degree slope with tile There are a few surprises in the drawers including a billy club Don t askwhat a dentist needs with one of those  The exam chair is very well done and the use of light aqua tiles just screams DENTIST  The window features a printed glass window insert emblazoned with the words Prevent Yellowing  Longtime LEGO fans will get the joke The cool window feels lost though since it s used on the window inside the square which is hard to see when you re looking at the build from the front I understand it wouldn t fit with the aesthetic of the frontfacing walls but it s sad it s beentucked away The star in the Photography studio is the old camera It s highly recognizable and is only 20 pieces It uses rods with balls as the tripod which are held between two 1 1 plates with clips The room is dominated by a brickbuilt backdrop that employs the curved 1x3x2 bricks to make a nice even studio backdrop It s even got the master roll of paper hanging at the top There s also a nifty little portrait of some old fellow in a business suit as an example of the photographer s work it will make the perfect decorationin an executive s office The Music Shop is fun There is a bright red electric guitar and a classic acoustic guitar along with a saxophone on display and a drum set The drum set is well done even though it uses few parts The register makes use of two of the new 1 2 45 degree angle with tiles in grey The Dance Studio is very simple perhaps more so then any other part of this build This floor has just one thing in the room a piano However it s a wonderfully designed upright piano making use of a tan 1 2 3 tooth piece for pedals The other item of note here is the practice bar There s a mirror made of a clear1x4x6 door frame insert with a beautifully reflective surface applied to one side This comes packed in its own resealable baggie so it won t be scratched It s held to the wall by the clips holding the bar two 1 1 clips and a row of 1 2 plates with door rails It s quite secure and looks perfect The roof is mostly just architectural details There is an access point and a skylight and the sides of the roof use halfarches and 1 1 bricks with scrolls For the corner detail it uses a white NexoKnight shield tile We saved the best for last the Loft Apartment  This room is packed with so much detail This is where the LEGO Fan lives And seriously props to her to have such a great loft apartment and still afford all the sets she s got on display  and food she has a kitchen so I am assuming she can afford to eat There s a super tiny micro version of 10182 Cafe Corner 10190 Market Street and 10185 Green Grocer up on the shelf She even has a MISB Cafe Corner stored against the wall This studio loft features a tiny bathroom a tiny kitchen with microwave and a pullout couch that actually functions The couchpulls out and lays flat nicely though getting it back into couch position is a tad difficult due to cramped quarters too small for most human hands  and I say this as a person with fairly small hands By the window there s a pretty large train layout with landscaping and a teensytiny 10233 Horizon Express going round the layout On the shelf isa micro version of the 10242 Mini Cooper and the 10220 VW Camper Van  and in the window you ll find the cutest little 10181 Eiffel Tower  No loft apartment is complete without a rooftop patio In this case you ve got some plants furniture and a great grilling area The muchvaunted use of excavator scoops for the roof actually works really well The roof over the loft apartment is pretty simplistic using more 1 1 bricks with scrolls and a white chicken Between the 1 1 bricks with scrolls are two stacked jumper plates topped off with a 1 2 plate giving a nice halfstud overlap on each row One thing that will be a bit of an annoyance to the LEGO men and women who live and work in Assembly Square is the access to all the floors since all of the upper floors require access through another roomTo get to the dentist s office you go through the bakery You go in one door and out the other at the dentist s office to go upstairs to the loft apartment Access to the music shop comes from an external door at the back of the coffee shop but you can t get to the dance studio without passing through the music shop that s one way to drum up business eh For a build with lots of details and some repetition Assembly Square manages to avoid feeling repetitive at all even when stacking the same bricks and putting tiles on for that sweet sweet exterior of the dentists office unlike 10253 Big Ben  The Parts Like all Modulars there are no stickers only printing Isn t it wonderful The amazing prints include a gorgeous 2 3 light blue tile as 10182 Cafe Corner The dentist s window is printed as are all of the 1 1 round tiles with donuts and pastries There are 1 1 quartercircle tiles printed as pie too There s the banker s portrait the suspension bridge and a newspaper printed on 2 2 tiles And while we re on the topic of printing there s an unprinted white chicken Assembly Square brings us enough new pieces to keep parts monkeys occupied for quite some time There are both new colors for existing elements as well as a number of brand new elements The recolors include 1 4 Bow Window in black Cheese slopes in medium dark flesh Inkwells in black the 1 1 round tile with rod A large number of fantastic parts are found in only one or two other sets And if you are looking to stock up on 1 2 bricks with grill in sand blue you ll find plenty of them here In addition to the recolored parts there are plenty of brand new parts Parrot  the parrot is a new mold and a bit different from the classic pirate s companion Here s a comparison of the new parrot blue and yellow dualinjection and a classic parrot 2 2 Angled tile  12 white 7 light grey 18 dark grey and 4 dark blue 2 2 Curved tile  6 light grey 4 4 Curved tile  4 light grey 1 2 Slope with tile  The angle and textured surface precisely matches that of a1 2 45 degree slope You ll get 2 dark grey and 2 white 1 1 brick with studs on 2 adjacent sides  which we re calling a half Travis brick 36 tan Angled door frame  1 each inwhite and black The Minifigures Like all Modulars the minifigs in this set have the classic yellow smiley face There are eight minifigs in this set plus a baby which comes with a plain white body The dentist features a new torso The Verdict 10255 Assembly Square is not likely to go on sale often but it s well worth it at full price This set is a love letter to the fan community and is packed with details we love new parts to drool over Easter eggs galore and is beautiful just to look at 10255 Assembly Square will be available January 1 2017 The LEGO Group sent The Brothers Brick an early copy of this set for review Providing TBB with products for review guarantees neither

Contact Us Search LEGO Star Wars Ultimate Collector s Series Snowspeeder 75144 Review The T47 airspeeder adapted for cold weather use on Hoth is the most memorable Rebel vehicle introduced in The Empire Strikes Back  and has been a staple of the LEGO Star Wars theme Commonly called the Snowspeeder this hardy little twoman craft first appeared in LEGO form in 1999with more than a dozen variations since across a variety of scales The latest iteration is also the largest and the Ultimate Collector s Series 75144 Snowspeeder packs a massive 1703 pieces As we announced last month it costs 19999 USD and is set to premiere on May the 4th aka Star Wars Day Like other recent UCS sets the Snowspeeder includes a stand information placard and two minifigure pilots The displayed ship comes in at 16 inches long 12  wide and 9  tall 41 x 30 x 23 cm Let s see how the Snowspeeder stacks up The box The box is appropriately large for a 200 set and includes lots of callout images on the back showing various features The box has little wasted space inside stuffed full with 13 numbered bags a loose oversized plateand tile and a sealed bag holding the hefty instruction book and stickers The instruction book is softbound but the wide pages allow it to lay open easily At 299 pages long there s more than enough room for some extensive background info as is traditional with UCS sets In addition to the basic facts about the source material and model there are interviews with the model designer graphic designer and art director The sizable sticker sheet covered in the model s 31 stickers The build Diving into the 462step build we start with a sturdy Technic frame surrounding the 2 2 hole that serves as the mounting point for the stand This is rock solid created with a Plate Modified 4 x 4 with 2 x 2 Cutout element 64799 stacked with boxshaped Technic beams The hole is just aft of the rear gunner giving the mounted model a great aggressive positioning This portion also includes the first of many fins cleverly created with minifigure hose nozzle s with triangular flags attached These fins surround the lower landing gear on the snowspeeder s bottom There are a few steps where I spotted two elements being used instead of a single larger one in one instance I noted two 1 3 plates laid end to end even though a 1 6 plate in the same color had been used a few steps before While it s theoretically possible there could be exigent circumstances for this a cynic might observe that tweaking just a few parts to push the model over that 1700piece total could have favorable marketing implications By the end of the second bag the cockpit is beginning to take shape incorporating Mixel ball joints along the edges to hold the lower halves of the wings In bag 3 are found some of the only printed elements in the set three 2 2 slopes printed with a new generic control panel One is placed in the pilot s console while the gunner receives the other two The only other printed elements in the set are the minifigures and the classic light grey 1 2 tiles with a Star Wars computer pattern introduced way back in the original XWing set in 1999 Additionally the pilot receives a pair of 1 2 slopes stickered with unique computer screens Handles on either side of the seat are created with submachine gun elements pointed barrel down while a pair of binoculars makes other details The mechanism for the moving harpoon gun is integrated early in the build It s a simple design consisting of a solid axle with gears for a 90 turn to the harpoon mount The second grey 8tooth gear that s sandwiched between the yellow and dark tan plates simply adds friction to the system To mesh the angled windows and roof the upper housing for the canopy incorporates some nifty techniques which are a bit unorthodox to see in an official model There s no wiggle room in the design and everything slots together with a satisfying certainty once aligned properly becoming firmly locked into place Moving forward we build the complex angles on the nose The simple solution to constructing panels with compound angles Use Mixel ball joints When initially attached the panels wobble freely but once the wings are attached they become solidly stationary Here we also see a few of the many minifigure ice skate elements which are used extensively on the underside for great little radiator details All told the snowspeeder uses 20 of the ice skates Here s that fin technique from bag 1 again adding detail deep within the wings While not strictly necessary it s details like this that help set a UCS model apart as a higher quality build The finished detail is barely visible if you look in just the right spot between the upper and lower wing halves butyou d likely never notice if it weren t there By the end of bag 6 the T47 is really taking shape and the minifigures placard and stand are in place The massive informational sticker is applied across a single 8 16 tile I first had the nervewracking experience of applying an enormous infoplaque sticker back in 2000 when I purchased the UCS TIE Interceptor 7181 In that set the sticker was applied across a series of 1 8 tiles I m disappointed however to note that although the intervening 17 years have brought improvements to nearly ever other facet of UCS builds we re still relegated to carefully applying a postcardsized sticker with a doorfail single attempt requiring rocksteady hands The lower wing halves connect to the body with the Mixel ball joints we saw earlier and are held in place with a single rubber band on each side Each wing is naturally a huge swatch of stacked plates Each of the two wings are identically mirrored save for a single element added to the right wing but the build doesn t feel overly repetitive As we move on to the engines I came across an annoying error The intake vent stickers which decorate the wing elements on the engine fronts are the wrong size for the piece The angles don t match the part so either you can tilt the sticker to get it all on the piece or you can align it properly and have it overhang slightly Interestingly the instruction manual seems to show this disparity as the sticker depicted in the manual doesn t match the element angles either The iconic rear cooling fins are made with stacked 4 4 tiles and have various details nestled among them including a number of vehicle bumper elements Here you can also see one of the flat silver 1 2 rails element 32028 They ve previously appeared in 3 other sets in 2016 but you ll get18 here And of course there s the new windscreen 6 8 studs at the bottom it slopes to 6 studs at the top matching the classic 1x2x3 slopes It s almost a shame to apply the requisite 5 stickers to it The 2x10x3 side windows element 24607 will also be new to many builders They re a redesign of the old 3x10x3 windscreen element 2694 making them a stud shallower The updated element first began appearing last year in the 10242 Mini Cooper although that set has been available for years the set number for the updated version remains the same It s also appeared in the 10252 Volkswagen Beetle  The model At last the finished model The ship looks the part well There s no denying that this is a spitting image of the Incom T47 Snowspeeder Although it s subtle the laser barrels gently angle in moving just a few studs over the length of the barrel It s not immediately obvious but it s a fantastic detail The front targeting sensors are made with a series of grille tiles while the homing sensors are stickers The cooling fins look terrific They re constructed as two subassemblies with each attaching via a pair of Technic pins Here you can also see the lower air brakes on either side of the cooling fins While the underside is naturally less detailed there s still plenty of little details The front landing gear is a tiny retractable skid attached with a click hinge The rear gear is a pair of doubleinverted grey slopes visible at the bottom the image With the front gear extended the snowspeeder can sit neatly on a flat surface with full clearance all the way around The airbrake flaps can be lowered manually and the piston elements extend and retract along with them The underside of the front gives another view of the Mixel ball joints being used for the complex angling There s a bit of greebling around the forward laser activator mounts and beneath the upper airbrake flaps The upper airbrake flaps are raised and lowered manually by turning the engine nacelles Oddly I kept expecting a cheese slope to be placed on the engine housing to finish the slopes It s missing on both the inner and outer sides of the housing and seems a glaring oversight The outer one is missing intentionally because it would interfere with the flap opening mechanism but there s no similar issues the inner one Fortunately this is easily fixable I suggest fishing out a pair of white cheese slopes and correcting this as I did in the image below The new wide canopy provides plenty of visibility for targeting Imperial walkers Now if only we had a UCS ATAT set  The canopy swings up giving access to both seats The strong click hinge holds the canopy s weight well allowing it to stay open at any of the three intermediate steps between closed and fully vertical The sole nonmirrored element on the wings seen with an orange sticker here is also surprisingly inaccurate That slope is a small vent but the model lacks a sticker on the vertical front of that slope showing the intake vent I could think of several brickbuilt solutions that would work here as well Moving the joystick on the harpoon targeting computer moves the harpoon gun back and forth The targeting computer is an inverted 2 2 tile with a sticker The harpoon gun uses a series of Technic pins and other small bits including two minifigure roller skates The stand is simple and very sturdy made of Technic beams The vertical portion can adjust to two positions one with the model perfectly level and the other with it canted toward the stand s front The snowspeeder can balance on the stand facing any of the cardinal directions If you prefer to display yoursnowspeederwith the stand reversed say to point the ship out and up you can do that too by turning the display stand around and attaching the placard to the other side where attachment points are provided The plates holding the minifigures would have t o be adjusted as well but that should be a trivial alteration The minifigures As LEGO has done since the 2011 Super Star Destroyer 10221 minifigures are included even though the model is a different scale Two Rebel figures in orange flightsuits are the offer here and are simply named Rebel Snowspeeder Pilot and Gunner on the box I can identify Zev Senesca in the pearl dark grey helmet but I m unsure which character the gunner represents Perhaps a more knowledgeable reader can name him in the comments Regardless there s very little new here The figures are identical except for the helmets and the torso legs and doublesided head have all appeared in other sets The arms gain a new print to help make these characters unique and while it s cool I can t help but feel that LEGO cheaped out That a 200 Ultimate Collector s Series set doesn t even have unique  let alone new  heads for the pilots is more than a bit disappointing Zev s pearl dark grey helmet looks great though The arm printing is nice but why these exclusive minifigures are forced to share a head is a mystery Conclusion  recommendation Comparisons to 2003 s 10129 Rebel Snowspeeder are inevitable While the old model was remarkably accurate especially compared to other Star Wars models of the time the new Snowspeeder is undeniably even more accurate The canopy is perhaps the biggest change with the addition of the new canopy element the shaping is spot on While the nose on the old craftwas made of stacked slopes the fini shed effect worked well It s hard to say the new nose design isn t better but by how much is matter up for argument If you already own the 2003 version this new design isn t likely to tempt you as much 10129 Rebel Snowspeeder from 2003 But before you get out your pitchforks to storm Billund for rehashing old material remember that it s been 14 years since that first UCS snowspeeder Just because you were collecting LEGO back in 2003 doesn t mean everyone was and there s an entire generation of LEGO fans who ve never had a chance to purchase a UCS snowspeeder for a reasonable price As we noted in our announcement  just a few months ago the 2003 version was selling for around 900 used or nearly two grand for a sealed copy At a mere 10 of that price many fans are happy to finally have a chance to acquire this iconic vehicle The release of the new snowspeeder is naturally dropping the bottom out of the original version s market rapidly which is bad news for resellers but great news for fans who just want cool LEGO models of their favorite Star Wars ships And make no mistake this is a very cool model Like many of the best Star Wars vehicles the snowspeeder is entrenched in an industrial aesthetic But what it lacks in smooth curves and flowing lines it makes up for in rugged utility and aggressive demeanor The price may cause some to hesitate and it s a fair criticism to note that the price is higher than average ringing in at 0117 per piece approximately 17 more expensive than the average  priceperpiece for LEGO sets However as any gradeschool mathematician can tell you having an average usually implies some things are below average and some are above There have always been sets that exceed the 10centsperpiece expectation and as long as they re solid sets we tend to forgive them At 199 for a 1703piece set that builds a killer model this one definitely counts as a solid set Plus it s the best Rebel vehicle from The Empire Strikes Back  which is the best Star Wars movie And who doesn t want that The LEGO Star Wars 75144 UCS Snowspeeder will be available May 4 for 19999 USD The LEGO Group sent The Brothers Brick a copy of this set for review Providing TBB with

 News Review  Star Wars Post navigation  Nassau is full of pirates and intrigue Happy happy joy joy  12 comments on  LEGO Star Wars Ultimate Collector s Series Snowspeeder 75144 Review  Brad April 11 2017 at 811 pm Good eye on Zev Senesca The yellow chevrons on the helmet match the character s helmet too There is a mention on Wookieepedia that a Kit Valent was Zev s gunner for the Battle of Hoth so maybe the gunner is Kit That said based on the card image for the Decipher Star Wars CCG Rogue 2 had some visible mechanical details on its starboard side like panels had been removed so this model probably doesn t represent Rogue 2 specifically That says to me that the gunner could be a different character too And before anyone asks I did fall in a small rabbit hole here  The Anonymous Hutt April 11 2017 at 917 pm Great review I appreciate it more than some of your other reviews because I actually collect Star Wars Lego However there is one part of your article I don t understand The sole nonmirrored element on the wings seen with an orange sticker here is also surprisingly inaccurate That slope is a small vent but the model lacks a sticker on the front showing any intake vent I could think of several brickbuilt solutions that would work here as well  I assume that you are referring to the orange sticker on the slope piece I believe that this sticker represents not a vent but a snowspeeder unit identifier just like on the XWings Red One Red Two Red Five etc They each have a certain number of stripes Based off of the quoted portion of the review I can only assume that you believe this sticker was a vent Is this true If I am missing something something entirely be sure to let me know as I have made these kinds of mistakes before P Chris Post author April 11 2017 at 926 pm The Anonymous Hutt Glad you enjoyed the review To answer your question I should have made it more clear that I was referring to the front vertical end of the slope not the sloped back with the orange sticker According to my reference material the front of that little protrusion is some sort of intake vent I feel a sticker or perhaps even better a bracket with a grille tile would have looked better there than the solid white face It s visible on any reference images showing the right side of the snowspeeder but particularly obvious here httpvignette3wikianocookienetstarwarsimages00dSnowspeederpngrevisionlatestcb20161110010008 Gedeon Maheux April 12 2017 at 503 am Looks great but in my opinion LEGO shouldn t rerelease existing models until all the major vehicles have been touched It s been over a decade and I m STILL waiting for the AWing to be released Give me that then you can refine refine refine This just makes me grumpy Smullie1138 April 12 2017 at 503 am Great review very tempted to purchase it on release About the stickers I wonder if it would make a big difference without applying them Although sometimes they are a necessary evil I tend to not apply them on my sets Especially on sloped pieces they appear not to hold their own after some time 10188 detention block I m looking at you How did it fair with the sloped pieces in this set Would you recommend applying all of the stickers Ryan April 12 2017 at 631 am Great review I m so happy about this set being rereleased As you state in your review there are lots of SW Lego fans that started collecting after this set was first released I started my collection in 2008 and this set has been a hole in my collection I ve come close a couple of times to spending several hundreds to buy on eBay but have not pulled the trigger Glad I waited May the 4th be with you brickplate April 12 2017 at 918 am Gedeon there have been at least four versions of the AWing already released Unless you mean a UCS version In which case I concur The BWing UCS set was actually one of their best UCS models IMHO Ged April 12 2017 at 927 am Brick yes I mean a UCS version of the AWing Starfighter The BWing and YWings were both incredible Why they ve made the AWing the black sheep of the LEGO Star Wars family I just don t know Found this awesome fan version but it s still just a fan creation  httpwwweurobrickscomforumindexphpforumstopic108296mocucsawing Chris Post author April 12 2017 at 1027 am Smullie1138 Great question I m not a fan of stickers at all but I apply them because it s unfair to review a set without actually building it the way it is on the box I think the model would suffer a bit without at least some of the stickers The really important ones are the white stripes on the side windows the engine intake vents and the homing sensor sticker on the lower nose And of course the UCS info placard The rest probably won t significantly alter the look of the model That being said if you intend to get this as a display model I d recommend applying all the stickers As a display model just sitting there you may as well apply the stickers and if some end up peeling you can take them off But there s no point in leaving them on the sticker sheet just because you re worried they may end up peeling eventually mortesv April 13 2017 at 502 am Great review In the beginning your mention this set to be the largest iteration of the snowspeeder That is not 100 correct  the 10129 was larger in terms of dimensions  Rob April 13 2017 at 1058 pm I don t mind that this has been rereleased per se what bothers me is that this craft only has appeared in a single film and it hasn t even been a recent one There are SO many worthy options available which actually appear in recent films  not limited to the awesome ATAT Rogue One This is yet another example of Lego rereleasing previously released sets Death Star Sandcrawler Xwing with few NEW UCS sets in recent times When s the Tantive IV rerelease incidentally That s even older than the Snowspeeder and was also in Rogue One Smullie1138 April 17 2017 at 628 am Chris thanks for replying I m really excited for this set and I think you re right about the application of the stickers As a display piece they would certainly improve the model on it s whole Scared already about applying that huge display sticker haha Comments are closed Support the Brothers Brick documentwritea targetself

is no different Built by Johan Keuterink  this huge modular palace has a few similarities to Buckingham Palace not just in its Neoclassical architecture style but also the two Royal Guards that the Queen has lent to protect the entrance Although the Baroque details will not be to everyone s taste the aim is to impress visiting heads of state and Johan s palace should certainly achieve such an aim I love intricate exterior street lights and the front door with some suitably impressive gold handles Johan has taken the time to ensure that his palace has a lavishly decorated interior

minifigure queen Buying a round may render you penniless When creating this digital LEGO model of three different buildings ukasz Libuszewski was inspired by the beautiful architecture of Prague On the right we have the pub on the ground floor and a museum showing the old town on the first floor There is a handy cashpoint just outside the pub so no excuses about running out of cash when it s time to buy drinks There is also a slightly abandoned looking tenement building on the left  it s definitely in need of repair Access to the lookout tower is via the central steps but take care as those shadowy stairs look a little eerie to me A view from the rear shows some of the interior design with the old town layout in the museum and some cosy looking tables and chairs all set up in the pub below I particularly like some of the architectural details such as the tan stonework around the window at the back of the pub and the use of the Elves keys in light blue grey within the lookout tower While this build is a digital build it has been beautifully crafted and although there a few elements that do not exist in LEGO s official collection it looks buildable in the brick  Like this

Fancy going Dutch at this pizza house The canal houses of Amsterdam are part of the United Nations World Heritage and are famous for their tall slim stature and ornate faades and stylised gablesWhile Barrie Crossan has not given his building much of a gable he has taken inspiration from those famous Dutch canal houses when designing his fivestorey LEGO pizza house If you look closely you will see some lovely decorative details on the faade and the back stairs on the bottom left leading directly to the restaurant s busy kitchen While the outside is attractive it s worth taking a look inside where Barry has made an effort to create a hugely detailed interior The apartment on the upper floors has an impressive sitting room with a dining area behind the couch The furniture is certainly not

floors for my little Tomica cars but my family left Japan before I ever played a proper game I still get nostalgic whenever I see Go games Joe Miller built this fully functional 9 9 Go set completely from LEGO using some rather complicated techniques to place the black lines on the board The lines themselves are the tops of 1 2 halfpanels wedged into full 3brick high panels combined with some serious sideways and upsidedown  SNOT  construction Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Andrew December 28 2014 Building Techniques  LEGO  Models Board Game  China  Japan Amazingly lifelike LEGO sculpture of the Monkey King  Tyler Halliwell is best known to our regular readers as a creator of amazing LEGO busts  So his latest work  depicting the Monkey King of Chinese mythology  is an ambitious departure in terms of its size and construction We think you ll agree that the attention to detail and the naturalness of this figure s clothing and facial expression are completely mindblowing We journeyed for several months across the Asian subcontinent rescuing helpless villagers from all manner of demons along the way to visit the mountain in which Tyler has been imprisoned for the past 500 years so we could find out more about this creation  BB  So how many hours and how many bricks went into this creation TH  That s tough to estimate but probably about 100 hours over the past two months with most of it coming into shape in the past two weeks There s less pieces than you d think as it s mostly hollow but for a technic frame So if I had to guess I would say around 1500 bricks BB  What inspired you to choose the Monkey King as the subject of your latest LEGO sculpture Continue reading  Like this post Tell all your

about five times that number will be attending AniCom ACGHK at the Hong Kong Convention Center LEGO fans are well catered for at ACGHK and the members of HKLUG always put on a good show TKH has taken a break from his usual Anime style builds to create this amazing tribute to Cantonese opera especially for the event  Pictured here in breathtaking detail and accuracy are two classic historical characters from the genre the scheming bureaucrat Cao Cao  and the heroic General Guan Yu  If you re not sure which is which I ll give you a hint Like almost every detail in a Chinese opera the color of the actors  masks is highly symbolic But the color code is the opposite to what Westerners might expect  Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr

Chinese equivalent to letting the cat out of the bag  And like many common sayings this one has a historical origin In 228 BC as a last ditch attempt to avoid invasion by its enemies the nation of Yan sent a man named Jing Ke to assassinate the King of Qin Using a map of Yan s most fertile areas as bait Jing Ke was able to get close to the King and as he unfurled it he pulled out a dagger that had been hidden inside Hong Kong builder Vincent Cheung  fvin yan  has created this fabulous portrayal of the attempted assassination in a style very similar to his Beauty and the Beast sculpture I love the freezeframe action of the characters and of course the threedimensional detailing on the map Vincent was clearly influenced by folk art depicting the event as you can see from this example Like

Contact Us Search Labour of love pit stop for hot rods recreated from real life Once in a while you see a build that not only looks great but simply blows it out of the water combining great details and huge playability potential This build by Andrea Lattanzio of a famous hot rod workshop is surely one of them What brings this place to life are the small details scattered around such as the electrical poles and the junkyard at the side Andrea tells us a little history of the Mooneyes Headquarters where gearheads and hot rod modders hang out to get their repairs and mods Today Mooneyes is still located in Santa Fe Springs California where it s been since 1962 The builder is obviously a huge fan and has painstakingly recreated the full workshop layout inside The build inside showcases two vehicles one of which is the iconic shop pickup truck The other is a hotrod which is likely undergoing an upgrade I suggest actually taking a moment to soak in the all the little details inside and out from the American flag to the electrical conduits and the 50gallon drums Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Related Edwinder

Contact Us Search Dale s RV from The Walking Dead in LEGO The notion of zombies walking the earth strikes me as completely ridiculous and I never got into the whole ApocaLEGO theme either but yet somehow I am completely hooked on The Walking Dead  I first saw an episode about two years ago and since have bingewatched the first four seasons and am camped in front of the TV for every new episode I can t really explain why Perhaps it s because some of the characters are so unsympathetic that the thought of a halfrotted zombie tearing their guts out is something to look forward to Nobody seems safe however and whenever the more likeable characters are killed off such as Dale Horvath in the 2nd season I feel pretty much gutted myself pun intended A lot of fanbuilt LEGO models based on The Walking D ead are focussed on customized minifigures but I wanted to have a vehicle from the show as part of my movie car collection  My choice Dale s Winnebago Chieftain RV In the first two seasons of the show the RV was usually in the center of the survivors  camp with Dale on the lookout on top of it A major inspiration for my version was the wonderful minifig scale version by Mr Zumbi  which we sadly failed to blog when he posted it a few years ago While many people undoubtedly prefer minifigs I like the details that the larger scale allows on my vehicles so having Dale to go with mine involved building a larger figure I also built Andrea and one of the walking dead The awning is designed such that it can easily be removed the vehicle has steering front wheels the door opens and it has a detailed interior It took about 30 hours to build spread out over a few weeks It s a big vehicle at roughly 40 cm 16 inches in length with loads of small details and a full interior  This puts the parts count at roughly 2000 give or take a few hundred I don t keep close track of the parts I use Whilst doing the research for my model I wanted to find out what others besides Mr Zumbi had already built so I searched for LEGO Dale s RV  and found a construction set of the vehicle by McFarlane Toys It may be called a construction set but I wouldn t touch it with a stick as it s really not like LEGO at all It is a scale model held together quite poorly judging from reviews not by glue but using a system similar to LEGO You d be hard pressed to build anything even halfdecent other than Dale s RV with the parts included The only part that can be used for just a single purpose on my LEGO model is the red umbrella which is a genuine LEGO part from the 1979 Fabuland hospital  Like

in the 1980s but has been transforming throughout the years into different generations of TV series and film franchises The original US series was based on Hasbro s Transformers toy line and involved giant mecha that can transform into vehicles although Hasbro s own toy line was based upon other toys made by Japanese manufacturer Takara with the opposing teams of Autobots and Decepticons at war with each other Alex Jones has built a fantastic collection of LEGO Autobots including Optimus Prime at the centre next to Jetfire the jet Bumblebee in his yellow VW Beetle state on the left and Windcharger the red sports car on the right How many of these Transformers can you name and remember playing with as a child Alex has just coauthored a book with another builder whose work we have featured on TBB Joachim Klang  Tips for Kids Transformers Cool Projects for your Lego Bricks is due out at the end of July 2017 and will help budding builders transform their brick s into Autobots and

Book  Character  Game of Thrones  TV Powered by the stars themselves Spanning two decades and achieving worldwide popularity the Stargate franchise gave Star Trek a pretty good run for its money  and is now even up for a movie reboot The final spinoff named Stargate Universe  tried to lure fans by adopting the grittier realism of shows like Battlestar Galactica  Unfortunately that shift didn t gel with audiences and the show was cancelled after just 2 seasons I m a huge SGU fan and was sad to see it go So when German builder namelessmember produced this beautiful model of the star ship Destiny  it was nice to be reminded I wasn t the only one  I really love the compactness of this build  it s probably the smallest scale that you could build Destiny at and still do it justice It has just the

motorcyles made with a handful of pieces so let s take a look at something bigger This model of the odd Lazareth LM 847 bike by ianying616 is created with mostly Technic pieces Comparing it to the original the builder has done a spoton job  this could be mistaken for a picture of the real thing from a distance All of it is good but I m a sucker for that engine detail and the tubing Like this

low parts counts and clever parts usage and they don t come better than this bike by Brian Kescenovitz  It won t pay to get into each clever use of apart because almost every brick that went into this is placed in an ingenious mannerHowever the use of the ExoForce leg for the fuel tank and the bad robot arm for the underside of the frame stand out among the rest as examples of perfect placement No less impressive are Brian s other tiny bikes a flowing white touring bike and a streamlined red racer Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn

some chrome to look like a million bucks He also turned out Daryl s legs for a more natural pose Jonas s other Walking Dead build is a gruesome scene featuring Negan There are a lot of interesting

LEGO  Models Motorcycle  The Walking Dead  Zombies LEGO Technic 42063 BMW R 1200 GS Adventure Review Unlike many of my childhood friends Ive never been fond of motorcycles Well some of them look cool and I heard some of them are really fast but while all of my mates spent hours drooling over pictures of bikes in auto magazines I was pretty content with a huge yellow pneumatic tractor from LEGO Technic on a table in my room And now 15 years later here I am feasting my e yes on the new LEGO Technic 42063 BMW R 1200 GS Adventure on my table thinking that Ivebeen missing something in my life till this very moment Although there have been plenty of LEGO Technic motorcycles before it this 603piece beauty is the first licensed motorcycle released and the retail price of 5999  4999 makes this BMW a solid bargain among all the licensed LEGO Technic sets Reviewing a BMW R 1200 GS set gives a lot of opportunity for reflection upon the licensed models in the Technic theme as well as comparing them to the old Model Team sets and this is what I d planned to base my review on until I got my hands on the set The problem is this BMW doesnt need to be compared to other bikes cars or cranes It stands out against every other 2017 Technic set Its announcement was highlighted by several official press releases emphasizing that this bike is a selfcontained and stand alone model Its not a primarily meantas toy nor is it merely a sophisticated mechanism or a dodgy Technic machine by Billund s designers Rather its a decent scaled copy of a BMW motorcycle made of Technic pieces  and this is what makes it genuinely beautiful Continue reading  Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Alexander February 26 2017 LEGO  Models BMW

Motorcycle Easy riding on your LEGO Chopper Chopper bikes were instantly popularized around the world following the 1969 film Easy Rider and this LEGO chopper motorcycle by red is a lovely example One of the features of this particular build is the sparing use of technic parts Instead red has chosen to create brick built features For example those oversized wheels have been painstakingly built using 1 1 round plates radiating out from an octagonal bar frame part The shapely brown leather seat is best seen from above this angle also allows the drive chain to be seen in all its functional

contest on Eurobricks The cellar section looks very livedin with weapons and sustenance positioned so it looks filled but not cluttered I should point out the use of broken tiles while not purist it is good that the builder found a way to still use his ruined pieces On the ground level we see some wellbuilt decay with a br oken window overgrowth and cracks in the walls Some nice minifig action

scarlet macaw is native to the humid evergreen forests of tropical South America you may wish to take this opportunity to have your own as a desktop pet There are definite advantages to owning the LEGO version designed by British builder Alan Mann  it will be a low maintenance and looks pretty without requiring too much grooming or feeding Alan has also provided an opportunity to enjoy the scarlet macaw in its natural habitat The wild open space of the forest is a much better place to see a real macaw but your LEGO macaw will regress into a statuelike state and refuse to fly if released

shuttle from Star Trek The Next Generation Instructions We re probably gonna see more Trek builds than usual this year it being the 30th anniversary of Star Trek The Next Generation  Such as this minifig scale Type 6 shuttle designed by Jerry builds LEGO  which captures the lines of this iconic vessel perfectly thanks to deft use of some canopies probably from a Star Wars set I m not even gonna check I assume it s a Star Wars set since there s not exactly a shortage of those to choose from As an added treat Mr Builds With LEGO has even put together this neat instructional video showing you how to build one of these for yourself I like the format of this video in which each step is shown being built so you can easily follow along The video doesn t show which sets you ll have to rip apart to get those lovely canopies or how far you ll have to search to find matching STNG minifigs  that s an exercise left for the viewer Of course in the Star Trek universe transporters are method of choice for getting from point A to point B But if you think really hard about it they re actually just giant death machines and the entire franchise is just the story of hoards of people and their subsequent clones willingly stepping into oblivion So it s no wonder there a few characters in the show actually opt to travel exclusively by shuttle craft Slower and more tedious but at least it gets to you your destination without being bloody vaporized  Like this post Tell all your friends Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Reddit More Tumblr LinkedIn Iain August 26 2017 LEGO  Models Instructions

shiny world of little plastic people surrounded by fake plastic trees but builder Emil Lid doesn t shy away from making a powerful statement with his latest LEGO creation Did you know that every piece of plastic ever produced yes including all the ABS that LEGO is made from will continue to exist indefinitely in the environment That there is a floating patch of trash in the middle of the Pacific Ocean hundreds of thousands of square kilometers in size Emil uses LEGO as a medium to remind us of the impact that our modern lives have on the planet we live on As much as I love the message that Emil s creation conveys it s also an excellent LEGO build on its own merits The tranquil beach scene above the water contrasts harshly with the waste beneath the waves from the usual tires and barrels

actually comes from the Spanish word flamenco which came from the earlier Latin word flamma meaning flame or fire The name seems all the more apt for this LEGO Flamingo created by BrickBro given that it s actually built from red bricks rather than pink The posing of this bird is perfectwith one foot characteristically tucked up whilst the other wades through the shallow water I love the dual purpose of the clear dish which firstly holds the bird in a standing position but also depicts a ripple in the water Those stick legs look just as fragile as an actual flamingo slegs This shapely bird has some clever albeit illegal  techniques in the neck area where the builder has used a short length of tubing to attach the tiles bottomtobottom The model is built only from LEGO parts however and
