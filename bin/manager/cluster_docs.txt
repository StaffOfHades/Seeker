on the characteristic intervals of pulsations of diminishing periods
in the electromagnetic field of the earth and their connection with
phenomena in the upper atmosphere  investigation by highspeed recording
of the daily variation of the earths em field has shown that during
strong magnetic storms characteristic intervals of pulsation occur
the decreasing period of these pulsations can be directly correlated
with the sharp atmospheric disturbances and the development of aurora in
lower latitudes  records obtained during two severe magnetic storms
in are discussed

ALTHOUGH FULL BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS TO NON-PRINT MATERIALS HAS BEEN A GOAL OF
LIBRARIES, COMPLETE SUCCESS HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED. THE LIBRARY AT CALIFORNIA
STATE UNIVERSITY, LOS ANGELES, SOUGHT A WAY TO ACCESS PREVIOUSLY INACCESSIBLE
ELEMENTS OF ITS RECORDINGS COLLECTION. THE COMPUTER-BASED MEDIA INDEX WAS
DESIGNED WITH SEPARATE INDEXES FOR TITLES, SUBJECTS, AND ADDED ENTRIES
(SELECTIONS, COMPOSERS, PERFORMERS, ETC.). THIS HAS PROVED TO BE AN EXTREMELY
USEFUL TOOL AND IS READILY ADAPTABLE TO OTHER FORMS OF MEDIATED MATERIAL.

experimental investigation of the aerodynamics of a
wing in a slipstream.
an experimental study of a wing in a propeller slipstream was
made in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the lift
increase due to slipstream at different angles of attack of the wing
and at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratios .  the
results were intended in part as an evaluation basis for different
theoretical treatments of this problem .
the comparative span loading curves, together with
supporting evidence, showed that a substantial part of the lift increment
produced by the slipstream was due to a destalling or
boundary-layer-control effect . the integrated remaining lift
increment, after subtracting this destalling lift, was found to agree
well with a potential flow theory .
an empirical evaluation of the destalling effects was made for
the specific configuration of the experiment.

on two-dimensional panel flutter .
theory and experiments of the flutter of a buckled plate are
discussed. it is shown that an increase in the initial deviation
from flatness or a static pressure differential across the plate
raises the critical value of the reduced velocity .
the applicability of the galerkin method to the linearized
problem of flutter of an unbuckled plate has been questioned by
several authors . in this paper the flutter condition was
formulated in the form of an integral equation and solved numerically
by the method of iteration and the method of matrix
approximations, thus avoiding the constraint of assumed modes . for a
plate (with finite bending rigidity) the results confirm those
given by the galerkin method .
an approximate analysis of the limiting form and amplitude of
the flutter motion for a buckled plate is presented.

transformation of the compressible turbulent boundary
layer .
the transformation of the compressible turbulent boundary
layer equations to their incompressible equivalent is
demonstrated analytically .  the transformation is essentially the same
as that for the laminar layer, first given by stewartson, except
that the explicit relation between the viscosity and temperature
is not required . a key point in the analysis is the modification
of the stream function to include a mean of the fluctuating
components and the postulate that the apparent turbulent shear,
associated with an elemental mass, remains invariant in the
transformation .
the values of the incompressible friction coefficients and of
pressure rise causing separation thus transformed show good
agreement with the experimentally measured and independently
reported results . an application of the transformation to the
self-preserving boundary layers and to the computations of
general boundary-layer flow is shown.

an investigation of the pressure distribution on conical bodies in
hypersonic flows.
a large amount of work on conical flow fields without axial symmetry
at supersonic speed is presently available . however, no apparent
hypersonic approximation has yet been derived. in this note,
experimental data on two elliptical cones at m = 6 are presented and a
hypersonic approach obtained from physical considerations is suggested .

on heat transfer in slip flow .
a number of authors have considered the effect of slip on the heat
transfer and skin friction in a laminar boundary layer over a flat plate .
reference 1 considers this by a perturbation on the usual laminar
boundary-layer analysis while some other studies.dash e.g., reference
the impulsive motion of an infinite plate .
